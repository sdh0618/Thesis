 abstract = {Truncated data play an important role in the statistical analysis of astronomical observations as well as in survival analysis. The motivating example for this article concerns a set of measurements on quasars in which there is double truncation. That is, the quasars are observed only if their luminosity occurs within a certain finite interval, bounded at both ends, with the interval varying for different observations. Nonparametric methods for the testing and estimation of doubly truncated data are developed. These methods extend some known techniques for data that are truncated only on one side, in particular Lynden-Bell's estimator and the truncated version of Kendall's tau statistic. However the kind of hazard function arguments that underlie the one-sided methods fail for two-sided truncation. Bootstrap and Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques are used here in their place. Finally, we apply these techniques to the quasar data, answering a question about their long-term luminosity evolution.},

abstract = {Optical and infrared light curves of classical novae are approximately homologous among various white dwarf (WD) masses and chemical compositions when free-free emission from optically thin ejecta is spherical and dominates the continuum flux of novae. Such a homologous template light curve is called ``a universal decline law.'' Various nova light curves are approximately reproduced from this universal law by introducing a timescaling factor which stretches or squeezes the template light curve to match the observation. The timescale of the light curve depends strongly on the WD mass but weakly on the chemical composition, so we are able to roughly estimate the WD mass from the light-curve fitting. We have applied the universal decline law to the old nova GK Persei 1901 and recent novae that outbursted in 2005. The estimated WD mass is 1.15 Msolar for GK Per, which is consistent with a central value of the WD mass determined from the orbital velocity variations. The other WD masses of 10 novae in 2005 are also estimated to be 1.05 Msolar (V2361 Cyg), 1.15 Msolar (V382 Nor), 1.2 Msolar (V5115 Sgr), 0.7 Msolar (V378 Ser), 0.9 Msolar (V5116 Sgr), 1.25 Msolar (V1188 Sco), 0.7 Msolar (V1047 Cen), 0.95 Msolar (V476 Sct), 0.95 Msolar (V1663 Aql), and 1.30 Msolar (V477 Sct), within a rough accuracy of +/-0.1 Msolar. Four (V382 Nor, V5115 Sgr, V1188 Sco, and V477 Sct) of 10 novae in the year 2005 are probably neon novae on an O-Ne-Mg WD. Each WD mass depends weakly on the chemical composition (especially the hydrogen content X in mass weight), i.e., the obtained WD masses increase by +0.5(X-0.35) Msolar for the six CO novae and by +0.5(X-0.55) Msolar for the four neon novae above. Various nova parameters are discussed in relation to its WD mass.},

abstract = {Context. The 340-yr old supernova remnant Cassiopeia A, located at 3.4 kpc distance, is the best-studied young core-collapse supernova remnant. Nucleosynthesis yields in radioactive isotopes have been studied with different methods, in particular for production and ejection of 44Ti and 56Ni, which originate in the innermost regions of the supernova. 44Ti was first discovered in this remnant, but is not seen consistently in other core-collapse sources. Aims: We aim to measure radioactive 44Ti ejected in Cassiopeia A and to place constraints on velocities of these ejecta by determining X- and $\gamma$-ray line-shape parameters of the emission lines. Methods: We analyzed the observations made with the SPI spectrometer on INTEGRAL together with an improved instrumental background method, to achieve a high spectroscopic resolution that enables interpretation for a velocity constraint on 44Ti ejecta from the 1.157 MeV $\gamma$-ray line of the 44Sc decay. Results: We observe both the hard X-ray line at 78 keV and the $\gamma$-ray line at 1157 keV from the 44Ti decay chain at a combined significance of 3.8$\sigma$. Measured fluxes are (2.1 {\textpm} 0.4) {\texttimes} 10-5 ph cm-2 s-1 and (3.5 {\textpm} 1.2) {\texttimes} 10-5 ph cm-2 s-1, which corresponds to (1.5 {\textpm} 0.4) {\texttimes} 10-4 and (2.4 {\textpm} 0.9) {\texttimes} 10-4 M⊙ of 44Ti, respectively. The measured Doppler broadening of the lines implies expansion velocities of 4300 and 2200 km s-1, respectively. By combining our results with previous studies, we determine a more precise estimate of ejected 44Ti of (1.37 {\textpm} 0.19) {\texttimes} 10-4 M⊙. Conclusions: The measurements of the two lines are consistent with previous studies. The flux in the line originating from excited 44Ca is significantly higher than the flux determined in the lines from 44Sc. Cosmic-ray acceleration within the supernova remnant may be responsible for an additional contribution to this line from nuclear de-excitation following energetic particle collisions in the remnant and swept-up material.},

Determinations of heavy-element concentrations in nova ejecta are reviewed, and possible interpretations of their origin are examined. We conclude that, of the 18 classical novae for which detailed abundance analyses are availble, only two (or possibly three) seem unambiguously to demand the presence of an underlying ONeMg white dwarf: V693 CrA 1981, V1370 Aql 1982, and possibly QU Vul 1984. Three other novae which exhibit significant neon enrichments, relative to their total heavy-element concentrations, are RR Pic 1925, V977, Sco 1989, and LMC 1990 No. 1. This result is entirely consistent with present frequency estimates, and our interpretation of the lower levels of enrichment in other systems explains, in a natural way, the existence of relatively low mass white dwarfs in some of the 'neon' novae.},

abstract = {The first $\gamma$-ray line originating from outside the Solar System that was ever detected is the 511 keV emission from positron annihilation in the Galaxy. Despite 30 years of intense theoretical and observational investigation, the main sources of positrons have not been identified up to now. Observations in the 1990s with OSSE/CGRO (Oriented Scintillation Spectrometer Experiment on GRO satellite/Compton Gamma Ray Observatory) showed that the emission is strongly concentrated toward the Galactic bulge. In the 2000s, the spectrometer SPI aboard the European Space Agency's (ESA) International Gamma Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) allowed scientists to measure that emission across the entire Galaxy, revealing that the bulge-to-disk luminosity ratio is larger than observed at any other wavelength. This mapping prompted a number of novel explanations, including rather ``exotic'' ones (e.g., dark matter annihilation). However, conventional astrophysical sources, such as type Ia supernovae, microquasars, or x-ray binaries, are still plausible candidates for a large fraction of the observed total 511 keV emission of the bulge. A closer study of the subject reveals new layers of complexity, since positrons may propagate far away from their production sites, making it difficult to infer the underlying source distribution from the observed map of 511 keV emission. However, in contrast to the rather well-understood propagation of high-energy ({\&}gt;GeV) particles of Galactic cosmic rays, understanding the propagation of low-energy (MeV) positrons in the turbulent, magnetized interstellar medium still remains a formidable challenge. The spectral and imaging properties of the observed 511 keV emission are reviewed and candidate positron sources and models of positron propagation in the Galaxy are critically discussed.},

abstract = {We estimate the rate and the luminosity function of short (hard) Gamma-Ray Bursts (sGRBs) that are non-Collapsars, using the peak fluxes and redshifts of BATSE, Swift and Fermi GRBs. Following Bromberg et al., we select a sub-sample of Swift bursts which are most likely non-Collapsars. We find that these sGRBs are delayed relative to the global star formation rate (SFR) with a typical delay time of a 3-4 Gyr (depending on the SFR model). However, if two or three sGRB at high redshifts have been missed because of selection effects, a distribution of delay times of $\propto$ 1/t would be also compatible. The current event rate of these non-Collapsar sGRBs with Liso > 5 {\texttimes} 1049 erg s-1 is 4.1_-1.9^+2.3 Gpc^-3 yr^-1. The rate was significantly larger around z {\~{ }} 1 and it declines since that time. The luminosity function we find is a broken power law with a break at 2.0_-0.4^+1.4 {\texttimes} 10^52 erg s^-1 and power-law indices 0.95_-0.1 2^+0.12 and 2.0_-0.8^+1.0. When considering the whole Swift sGRB sample we find that it is composed of two populations: one group ($\approx$60-80 per cent of Swift sGRBs) with the above rate and time delay and a second group ($\approx$20-40 per cent of Swift sGRBs) of potential `impostors' that follow the SFR with no delay. These two populations are in very good agreement with the division of sGRBs to non-Collapsars and Collapsars suggested recently by Bromberg et al. If non-Collapsar sGRBs arise from neutron star merger this rate suggest a detection rate of 3-100 yr-1 by a future gravitational wave detectors (e.g. Advanced Ligo/Virgo with detection horizon on 300 Mpc), and a co-detection with Fermi (Swift ) rate of 0.1-1 yr-1 (0.02-0.14 yr-1). We estimate that about 4 {\texttimes} 10^5 (f_b^-1/30) mergers took place in the Milky Way. If 0.025M⊙ were ejected in each event this would have been sufficient to produce all the heavy r-process material in the Galaxy.},

abstract = {In Bray {\&} Eldridge, we proposed a simple neutron star (NS) `kick' formula, v_kick=$\alpha$ (M_ejecta / M_remnant) + $\beta$ to explain the observed 2D velocities of young single NSs. Using this kick we found that there is no statistically significant preference for a kick orientation nor for any of the three initial mass function (IMF) slopes tested, and that populations including binary stars reproduced the kick distribution better than single-star only populations. However, recent analysis by Janka prompted us to revisit our basic assumptions and our new analysis has led to revised `best-fitting' kick values of $\alpha$ =100 km s^-1 and $\beta$ =-170 km s^-1. The reduction of $\beta$ to a negative value is due to using the 2D observed kick velocity distribution rather than the modelled 3D velocity distribution for NSs. To further test the validity of the new kick, we have created synthetic populations of runaway star and double neutron star (DNS) binaries at solar metallicity (Z = 0.020) using our best-fitting kick. We find our new kick values create runaway star velocities and DNS period distributions in agreement with the comparable observational distributions with only the DNS eccentricities in tension with the observations. From our DNS and black hole-black hole (BH-BH) data sets we estimate a predicted DNS merger rate at solar metallicity of 3864^+1,570_-2,371 Gpc-3 yr-1 and a BH-BH merger rate of 5^+40_-1 Gpc-3 yr-1.},

By converting its kinetic energy into pairs, such a particle could produce a substantial fraction of the 511 keV line observed by the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory/SPI in the inner Milky Way. Only a small fraction of the dark matter candidates have sufficient energy to excite, and that fraction drops sharply with galactocentric radius, naturally yielding a radial cutoff, as observed. Even if the scattering probability in the inner kpc is ≪1% per Hubble time, enough power is available to produce the ∼3{\texttimes}1042 pairs per second observed in the galactic bulge. We specify the parameters of a pseudo-Dirac fermion designed to explain the positron signal, and find that it annihilates chiefly to e+e- and freezes out with the correct relic density. We discuss possible observational consequences of this model.},

abstract = {By collecting the information from 24 previously published lists and catalogs, we produce a comprehensive catalog (Master Catalog) of 1442 Galactic HII regions. For each object, we quote the original fluxes and diameters as well as the available information on radio line velocities, line widths and line temperatures and the errors on these quantitities. References to the original works are also reported. By exploiting all these data we produce a Synthetic Catalog of fluxes and diameters (with corresponding errors) at 2.7 GHz. This choice is motivated by the extensive, although not complete, information available at this frequency, widely spread among many different catalogs, and by its relevance for both detailed studies on Galactic HII regions and the extrapolation up to millimetric wavelengths. The catalog can be used for detailed studies of Galactic HII regions and, by extrapolation, for investigations of HII regions up to millimetric wavelengths. In particular, we discuss the study of the effects of microwave emission from HII regions on the new generation of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments. We present simulations of the detection of HII regions in the PLANCK high resolution CMB survey, and briefly analize some of the typical applications of our catalog to the evaluation of CMB anisotropy experiments such as calibration, beam reconstruction and straylight effects. The Master Catalog and the Synthetic Catalog are available via ftp at: cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr. This work is related to PLANCK-LFI activities. The Master Catalog and the Synthetic Catalog are only available in electronic form via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/397/213},

The total value of the power-law index of the flare frequency distribution as a function of energy (dN/dE vprop E -$\gamma$) between 5 {\texttimes} 1034 and 1036 erg is on average $\gamma$ = 2.04 {\textpm} 0.17, which is in agreement with previous results. The $\gamma$ values of eight stars with frequent flaring activity vary between 1.59 {\textpm} 0.06 and 2.11 {\textpm} 0.19, suggesting a possible diversity of energy release effects. In general, stars with shorter rotation periods tend to have larger $\gamma$ values. There is an indication that the flare energy is saturated at about 2 {\texttimes} 1037 erg. For a few large superflares of this energy range, it is found that their temporal behaviors could be characterized by a transition from single impulsive flares to long-duration flares composed of several flares.},

abstract = {V959 Mon is a nova detected in gamma-rays. It was discovered optically about 50 days after the gamma-ray detection owing to its proximity to the Sun. The nova{\textquoteright}s speed class is unknown because of the lack of the earlier half of its optical light curve and a short supersoft X-ray phase due to eclipse by the disk rim. Using the universal decline law and time-stretching method, we analyzed the data on V959 Mon and obtained nova parameters. We estimated the distance modulus in the V band to be (m - M) V = 13.15 {\textpm} 0.3 for the reddening of E(B - V) = 0.38 {\textpm} 0.01 by directly comparing it with novae of a similar type{\textemdash}LV Vul, V1668 Cyg, IV Cep, and V1065 Cen. The distance to V959 Mon is 2.5 {\textpm} 0.5 kpc. If we assume that the early phase of the light curve of V959 Mon is the same as that of time-stretched light curves of LV Vul, our model fitting of the light curve suggests that the white dwarf (WD) mass is 0.9-1.15 M ⊙, which is consistent with a neon nova identification. At the time of gamma-ray detection the photosphere of the nova envelope extends to 5-8 R ⊙ (about two or three times the binary separation) and the wind mass-loss rate is (3{--}4){\texttimes} {10}-5 {M}⊙ yr-1. The period of hard X-ray emission is consistent with the time of appearance of the companion star from the nova envelope. The short supersoft X-ray turnoff time is consistent with the epoch when the WD photosphere shrank to behind the rising disk rim, which occurred 500 days before nuclear burning turned off.},

This Bayesian inference tool calculates the evidence, with an associated error estimate, and produces posterior samples from distributions that may contain multiple modes and pronounced (curving) degeneracies in high dimensions. The developments presented here lead to further substantial improvements in sampling efficiency and robustness, as compared to the original algorithm presented in Feroz {\&} Hobson, which itself significantly outperformed existing Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques in a wide range of astrophysical inference problems. The accuracy and economy of the MULTINEST algorithm are demonstrated by application to two toy problems and to a cosmological inference problem focusing on the extension of the vanilla $\Lambda$ cold dark matter model to include spatial curvature and a varying equation of state for dark energy. The MULTINEST software, which is fully parallelized using MPI and includes an interface to COSMOMC, is available at http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/software/multinest/. It will also be released as part of the SUPERBAYES package, for the analysis of supersymmetric theories of particle physics, at http://www.superbayes.org.},

The coincidence measurement technique in two scintillation detector layers requires specific analysis methods. Straightforward event projection into the sky is impossible. Therefore, detector events are analyzed in a multi-dimensional data-space using a gamma ray sky hypothesis convolved with the point spread function of the instrument in this data-space. Background suppression and analysis techniques have important implications on the gamma ray source results for this background limited telescope. The COMPTEL collaboration applies a software system of analysis utilities, organized around a database management system. The use of this system for the assistance of guest investigators at the various collaboration sites and external sites is foreseen and allows different detail levels of cooperation with the COMPTEL institutes, dependent on the type of data to be studied.},

abstract = {Significant advances have been made in the understanding of the diffuse Galactic hard X-ray continuum emission using data from the INTEGRAL observatory. The diffuse hard power-law component seen with the SPectrometer on INTEGRAL (SPI) has been identified with inverse-Compton emission from relativistic (GeV) electrons on the cosmic microwave background and Galactic interstellar radiation field. In the present analysis, SPI data from 2003 to 2009, with a total exposure time of {\textasciitilde}108 s, are used to derive the Galactic ridge hard X-ray spatial distribution and spectrum between 20 keV and 2.4 MeV. Both are consistent with predictions from the GALPROP code. The good agreement between measured and predicted emission from keV to GeV energies suggests that the correct production mechanisms have been identified. We discuss the potential of the SPI data to provide an indirect probe of the interstellar cosmic-ray electron distribution, in particular for energies below a few GeV.},

Here we show detailed studies of a scenario that has been proposed earlier by Lattimer {\&} Schramm, Symbalisty {\&} Schramm, Eichler et al., and Davies et al., namely the merger of two neutron stars. The results of hydrodynamic and full network calculations are combined in order to investigate the relevance of this scenario for r-process nucleosynthesis. Sufficient material is ejected to explain the amount of r-process nuclei in the Galaxy by decompression of neutron star material. Provided that the ejecta consist of matter with a proton-to-nucleon ratio of Ye{\textasciitilde}0.1, the calculated abundances fit the observed solar r-pattern excellently for nuclei that include and are heavier than the A{\textasciitilde}130 peak.},

abstract = {The OSSE instrument on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) was used to measure the one-dimensional latitudinal and longitudinal distributions of positron annihilation radiation (annihilation line and positronium continuum components) along the inner Galactic ridge. Intensity measurements near the Galactic center (differential relative to background fields offset by 9{\textdegree}-12{\textdegree}) show a symmetrical and spatially narrow bulge around the center (effective FWHMs of 4.9d+/-0.7d in Galactic latitude and 6.3d+/-1.5d in longitude) with significant disk contributions to at least 35{\textdegree} in longitude. The latitude width of the Galactic plane emission away from the Galactic center is only weakly constrained in the current analysis. The longitudinal distribution is well fitted by either a model comprising a narrow ({\textasciitilde}6.3d FWHM ) Gaussian bulge plus {\textasciitilde}35{\textdegree} FWHM Gaussian and CO-like disk components, or by a center-truncated R1/4 spheroid plus exponential disk model. For the latter model, the observed narrow latitudinal distribution near the Galactic center suggests that the bulge is ellipsoidal, although the fits are consistent with a spherical bulge as well. The positronium fraction estimate from the Galactic center direction is 0.93+/-0.04. This, combined with the existing narrow line width measurements for the 511 keV annihilation line, suggests that the bulk of the positron annihilation from the Galactic center direction occurs after positronium formation in a warm environment. The inner Galaxy total annihilation radiation flux intensities of {\textasciitilde}10.6{\texttimes}10-3 to {\textasciitilde}13.7{\texttimes}10-3 cm-2 s-1 implied by the fitted R1/4 ellipsoid plus exponential disk model (narrow and broad disks, respectively) are in agreement with intensities implied by the 511 keV line flux observed by the broad-field SMM instrument. The double-Gaussian plus CO disk model gives similar agreement if a broad ({\textasciitilde}12{\textdegree} FWHM) disk component is assumed.},

abstract = {Demographic studies of cosmic populations must contend with measurement errors and selection effects. We survey some of the key ideas astronomers have developed to deal with these complications, in the context of galaxy surveys and the literature on corrections for Malmquist and Eddington bias. From the perspective of modern statistics, such corrections arise naturally in the context of multilevel models, particularly in Bayesian treatments of such models: hierarchical Bayesian models. We survey some key lessons from hierarchical Bayesian modeling, including shrinkage estimation, which is closely related to traditional corrections devised by astronomers. We describe a framework for hierarchical Bayesian modeling of cosmic populations, tailored to features of astronomical surveys that are not typical of surveys in other disciplines. This thinned latent marked point process framework accounts for the tie between selection (detection) and measurement in astronomical surveys, treating selection and measurement error effects in a self-consistent manner.},

The temporal evolution of the infrared spectral energy distributions at 1272, 1616, and 1947 days can be explained by the emissions produced by amorphous carbon dust of mass (6.6-8.7) {\texttimes} 10-8 M⊙ with a representative grain size of 0.01 $\mu$m and astronomical silicate dust of mass (3.4-4.3) {\texttimes} 10-7 M⊙ with a representative grain size of 0.3-0.5 $\mu$m. Both of these dust species travel farther away from the white dwarf without apparent mass evolution throughout those later epochs. The dust formation scenario around V1280 Sco suggested from our analyses is that the amorphous carbon dust is formed in the nova ejecta followed by the formation of silicate dust either in the expanding nova ejecta or as a result of the interaction between the nova wind and the circumstellar medium.},

abstract = {The Fermi bubbles are two large structures in the gamma-ray sky extending to 55{\textdegree} above and below the Galactic center. We analyze 50 months of Fermi Large Area Telescope data between 100 MeV and 500 GeV above 10{\textdegree} in Galactic latitude to derive the spectrum and morphology of the Fermi bubbles. We thoroughly explore the systematic uncertainties that arise when modeling the Galactic diffuse emission through two separate approaches. The gamma-ray spectrum is well described by either a log parabola or a power law with an exponential cutoff. We exclude a simple power law with more than 7$\sigma$ significance. The power law with an exponential cutoff has an index of 1.9 {\textpm} 0.2 and a cutoff energy of 110 {\textpm} 50 GeV. We find that the gamma-ray luminosity of the bubbles is 4.4+2.4-0.9 {\texttimes} 1037 erg s-1. We confirm a significant enhancement of gamma-ray emission in the southeastern part of the bubbles, but we do not find significant evidence for a jet. No significant variation of the spectrum across the bubbles is detected. The width of the boundary of the bubbles is estimated to be 3.4+3.7-2.6 deg. Both inverse Compton (IC) models and hadronic models including IC emission from secondary leptons fit the gamma-ray data well. In the IC scenario, synchrotron emission from the same population of electrons can also explain the WMAP and Planck microwave haze with a magnetic field between 5 and 20 $\mu$G.},

abstract = {<i>Aims. <i/>We study the massive stars in OB{\textasciitilde}associations and their surrounding interstellar medium environment, using a population synthesis code. <i>Methods. <i/> We developed a new population synthesis code for groups of massive stars, where we model the emission of different forms of energy and matter from the stars of the association. In particular, the ejection of the two radioactive isotopes <sup>26<sup/>Al and <sup>60<sup/>Fe is followed, as well as the emission of hydrogen ionizing photons, and the kinetic energy of the stellar winds and supernova explosions. We investigate various alternative astrophysical inputs and the resulting output sensitivities, especially effects due to the inclusion of rotation in stellar models. As the aim of the code is the application to relatively small populations of massive stars, special care is taken to address their statistical properties. Our code incorporates both analytical statistical methods applicable to small populations, as well as extensive Monte Carlo simulations. <i>Results. <i/> We find that the inclusion of rotation in the stellar models has a large impact on the interactions between OB associations and their surrounding interstellar medium. The emission of <sup>26<sup/>Al in the stellar winds is strongly enhanced, compared to non-rotating models with the same mass-loss prescription. This compensates the recent reductions in the estimates of mass-loss rates of massive stars due to the effects of clumping. Despite the lower mass-loss rates, the power of the winds is actually enhanced for rotating stellar models. The supernova power (kinetic energy of their ejecta) is decreased due to longer lifetimes of rotating stars, and therefore the wind power dominates over supernova power for the first 6{\textasciitilde}Myr after a burst of star-formation. For populations typical of nearby star-forming regions, the statistical uncertainties are large and clearly non-Gaussian.},

Several frequency-spatial distributions of novae have been investigated using recent results of nova rates and spatial distributions of novae in our Galaxy. These models allow us to estimate the lower limit of the 22Na mass ejected per ONe nova detectable with the future spectrometer (SPI) of the INTEGRAL observatory as a function of the frequency-spatial distribution of ONe novae in the Galaxy. Calculations using recent estimations of the expected 22Na mass ejected per ONe nova show that the detection of the Galactic emission of 1.275-MeV photons will be difficult with the future spectrometer of the INTEGRAL observatory, whereas the cumulative emission around the Galactic Centre has some chance of being detected during the deep survey of the central radian of the Galaxy.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose that the accelerated electrons in the quiet Sun could collide with the solar atmosphere to emit Hard X-rays (HXRs) via non-thermal bremsstrahlung, while some of these electrons would move upwards and escape into the interplanetary medium, to form a superhalo electron population measured in the solar wind. After considering the electron energy loss due to Coulomb collisions and the ambipolar electrostatic potential, we find that the sources of the superhalo could only occur high in the corona (at a heliocentric altitude 1.9 R_ (the mean radius of the Sun)), to remain a power-law shape of electron spectrum as observed by STEREO at 1AU near solar minimum (Wang et al., 2012). The modeled quiet-Sun HXRs related to the superhalo electrons fit well to a power-law spectrum, f $\varepsilon$-$\gamma$, with an index $\gamma$ $\approx$ 2.0 - 2.3 (3.3 - 3.7) at 10 - 100 keV, for the warm/cold thick-target (thin-target) emissions produced by the downward-traveling (upward-traveling) accelerated electrons. These simulated quiet-Sun spectra are significantly harder than the observed spectra of most solar HXR flares. Assuming that the quiet-Sun sources cover 5% of the solar surface, the modeled thin-target HXRs are more than six orders of magnitude weaker than the RHESSI upper limit for quiet-Sun HXRs (Hannah et al., 2010). Using the thick-target model for the downward-traveling electrons, the RHESSI upper limit restricts the number of downward-traveling electrons to at most $\approx$3 times the number of escaping electrons. This ratio is fundamentally different from what is observed during solar flares associated with escaping electrons where the fraction of downward-traveling electrons dominates by a factor of 100 to 1000 over the escaping population.},

abstract = {The development of germanium Compton telescopes for nuclear gamma -ray astrophysics ( {\textasciitilde} 0.2-20 MeV) requires new event reconstruction techniques to accurately determine the initial direction and energy of photon events, as well as to consistently reject background events. This paper describes techniques for event reconstruction, accounting for realistic instrument/detector performance and uncertainties. An especially important technique is Compton Kinematic Discrimination, which allows proper interaction ordering and background rejection with high probabilities. The use of these techniques are crucial for the realistic evaluation of the performance and sensitivity of any germanium Compton telescope configuration.},

abstract = {On August 17, 2017 at 12∶41:04 UTC the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors made their first observation of a binary neutron star inspiral. The signal, GW170817, was detected with a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 32.4 and a false-alarm-rate estimate of less than one per 8.0 {\texttimes}104 years . We infer the component masses of the binary to be between 0.86 and 2.26 M⊙ , in agreement with masses of known neutron stars. Restricting the component spins to the range inferred in binary neutron stars, we find the component masses to be in the range 1.17 - 1.60 M⊙ , with the total mass of the system 2.7 4-0.01+0.04M⊙ . The source was localized within a sky region of 28 deg2 (90% probability) and had a luminosity distance of 4 0-14+8 Mpc , the closest and most precisely localized gravitational-wave signal yet. The association with the $\gamma$ -ray burst GRB 170817A, detected by Fermi-GBM 1.7 s after the coalescence, corroborates the hypothesis of a neutron star merger and provides the first direct evidence of a link between these mergers and short $\gamma$ -ray bursts. Subsequent identification of transient counterparts across the electromagnetic spectrum in the same location further supports the interpretation of this event as a neutron star merger. This unprecedented joint gravitational and electromagnetic observation provides insight into astrophysics, dense matter, gravitation, and cosmology.},

abstract = {Classical novae show a rapid rise in optical brightness over a few hours. Until recently the rise phase, particularly the phenomenon of a pre-maximum halt, was observed sporadically. Solar observation satellites observing coronal mass ejections enable us to observe the pre-maximum phase in unprecedented temporal resolution. We present observations of V5589 Sgr with STEREO HI-1B at a cadence of 40 min, the highest to date. We temporally resolve a pre-maximum halt for the first time, with two examples each rising over 40 min then declining within 80 min. Comparison with a grid of outburst models suggests that this double peak, and the overall rise time-scale, is consistent with a white dwarf mass, central temperature and accretion rate close to 1.0 M⊙, 5 {\texttimes} 107 K and 10-10 M⊙ yr-1, respectively. The modelling formally predicts mass-loss onset at JD 245 6038.2391 {\textpm} 0.0139, 12 h before the optical maximum. The model assumes a main-sequence donor. Observational evidence is for a subgiant companion, meaning that the accretion rate is underestimated. Post-maximum, we see erratic variations commonly associated with much slower novae. Estimating the decline rate is difficult, but we place the time to decline two magnitudes as 2.1 < t2(d) < 3.9, making V5589 Sgr a 'very fast' nova. The brightest point defines 'day 0' as JD 245 6038.8224 {\textpm} 0.0139, although at this high cadence the meaning of the observed maximum becomes difficult to define. We suggest that such erratic variability normally goes undetected in faster novae due to the low cadence of typical observations, implying that erratic behaviour is not necessarily related to the rate of decline.},

abstract = {New large-scale CO surveys of the first and second Galactic quadrants and the nearby molecular cloud complexes in Orion and Taurus, obtained with the CfA 1.2 m telescope, have been combined with 31 other surveys obtained over the past two decades with that instrument and a similar telescope on Cerro Tololo in Chile, to produce a new composite CO survey of the entire Milky Way. The survey consists of 488,000 spectra that Nyquist or beamwidth (1/8deg) sample the entire Galactic plane over a strip 4deg-10deg wide in latitude, and beamwidth or 1/4deg sample nearly all large local clouds at higher latitudes. Compared with the previous composite CO survey of Dame et al. (1987), the new survey has 16 times more spectra, up to 3.4 times higher angular resolution, and up to 10 times higher sensitivity per unit solid angle. Each of the component surveys was integrated individually using clipping or moment masking to produce composite spatial and longitude-velocity maps of the Galaxy that display nearly all of the statistically significant emission in each survey but little noise. The composite maps provide detailed information on individual molecular clouds, suggest relationships between clouds and regions widely separated on the sky, and clearly display the main structural features of the molecular Galaxy. In addition, since the gas, dust, and Population I objects associated with molecular clouds contribute to the Galactic emission in every major wavelength band, the precise kinematic information provided by the present survey will form the foundation for many large-scale Galactic studies. A map of molecular column density predicted from complete and unbiased far-infrared and 21 cm surveys of the Galaxy was used both to determine the completeness of the present survey and to extrapolate it to the entire sky at |b|<32deg. The close agreement of the observed and predicted maps implies that only {\textasciitilde}2% of the total CO emission at |b|<32deg lies outside our current sampling, mainly in the regions of Chamaeleon and the Gum Nebula. Taking into account this small amount of unobserved emission, the mean molecular column density decreases from {\textasciitilde}3{\texttimes}1020 cm-2 at |b|=5deg to {\textasciitilde}0.1{\texttimes}1020 cm-2 at |b|=30deg this drop is {\textasciitilde}6 times steeper than would be expected from a plane-parallel layer, but is consistent with recent measurements of the mean molecular column density at higher latitudes. The ratio of the predicted molecular column density map to the observed CO intensity map provides a calibration of the CO-to-H2 mass conversion factor X$\equiv$NH2/WCO. Out of the Galactic plane (|b|>5deg), X shows little systematic variation with latitude from a mean value of (1.8+/-0.3){\texttimes}1020 cm-2 K-1 km-1 s. Given the large sky area and large quantity of CO data analyzed, we conclude that this is the most reliable measurement to date of the mean X value in the solar neighborhood.},

These gamma rays, a unique signature of the thermonuclear runaway models of novae, would result from the annihilation of positrons emitted by beta(+)-unstable nuclei produced near the peak of the runaway and carried by rapid convection to the surface of the nova envelope. Simple models, which are extensions of detailed published models, of the expansion of the nova atmospheres are evolved. These models serve as input into investigations of the fate of nearby Galactic fast novae could yield detectable fluxes of electron-positron annihilation gamma rays produced by the decay of N-13 and F-18. Although nuclear gamma-ray lines are produced by other nuclei, it is unlikely that the fluxes at typical nova distances would be detectable to present and near-future instruments.},

abstract = {Context: The PICsIT detector onboard the INTEGRAL satellite was designed to provide information about emission in the soft $\gamma$-ray band for many bright sources. Due to strong and variable instrumental background, only 4 objects have been detected so far using standard software. Aims: The moderate sensitivity of PICsIT can be compensated for in the case of many objects by adopting a long exposure time, thanks to INTEGRAL's large field of view and an observing strategy focused on the Galactic plane. With angular resolution far higher than that of all other instruments operating in a similar energy band, PICsIT is suitable for fields too crowded or too significantly affected by Galactic diffuse emission. Therefore, it is desirable to improve the spectral extraction software to both obtain more reliable results and enlarge the number of objects that can be studied. Methods: The new PICsIT spectral extraction method is based on three elements: careful modelling of the background, an energy-dependent pixel-illumination function, and the computation of the probability density of the source count rate. Background maps of the detector plane are prepared for short periods and relatively narrow energy bands to insure that the background dependence on time and energy is modelled well. The most important element of the new spectral extraction method is the proper treatment of the Poisson-distributed data, developed within a Bayesian framework. Results: The new method was tested extensively on both a large true data set and simulated data. Results assumed in simulations were reproduced perfectly, without any bias and with high precision. Count rates measured for Crab were far more stable than those obtained with the standard software. For weaker sources, the new method produced spectra of far higher quality and allows us to detect at least 8 additional objects. Comparison with other INTEGRAL instruments demonstrated that PICsIT is well calibrated and provides valuable information about the continuum emission in the 250 keV - 1 MeV band, detectable currently only by INTEGRAL.},

abstract = {We compare the full-sky morphology of the 511 keV gamma ray excess measured by the INTEGRAL/SPI experiment to predictions of models based on dark matter (DM) scatterings that produce low-energy positrons: either MeV-scale DM that annihilates directly into e+e- pairs, or heavy DM that inelastically scatters into an excited state (XDM) followed by decay into e+e- and the ground state. By direct comparison to the data, we find that such explanations are consistent with dark matter halo profiles predicted by numerical many-body simulations for a Milky Way-like galaxy. Our results favor an Einasto profile over the cuspier NFW distribution and exclude decaying dark matter scenarios whose predicted spatial distribution is too broad. We obtain a good fit to the shape of the signal using six fewer degrees of freedom than previous empirical fits to the 511 keV data. We find that the ratio of flux at Earth from the galactic bulge to that of the disk is between 1.9 and 2.4, taking into account that 73% of the disk contribution may be attributed to the beta decay of radioactive 26Al.},

abstract = {Using the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis code, BPASS, we have calculated the rates, time-scales and mass distributions for binary black hole (BH) mergers as a function of metallicity. We consider these in the context of the recently reported first Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) event detection. We find that the event has a very low probability of arising from a stellar population with initial metallicity mass fraction above Z = 0.010 (Z ≳ 0.5 Z⊙). Binary BH merger events with the reported masses are most likely in populations below 0.008 (Z ≲ 0.4 Z⊙). Events of this kind can occur at all stellar population ages from 3 Myr up to the age of the Universe, but constitute only 0.1-0.4 per cent of binary BH mergers between metallicities of Z = 0.001 and 0.008. However at metallicity Z = 10-4, 26 per cent of binary BH mergers would be expected to have the reported masses. At this metallicity, the progenitor merger times can be close to $\approx$10 Gyr and rotationally mixed stars evolving through quasi-homogeneous evolution, due to mass transfer in a binary, dominate the rate. The masses inferred for the BHs in the binary progenitor of GW 150914 are amongst the most massive expected at anything but the lowest metallicities in our models. We discuss the implications of our analysis for the electromagnetic follow-up of future LIGO event detections.},

abstract = {We report the first Jupiter X-ray observations planned to coincide with an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME). At the predicted ICME arrival time, we observed a factor of ∼8 enhancement in Jupiter's X-ray aurora. Within 1.5 h of this enhancement, intense bursts of non-Io decametric radio emission occurred. Spatial, spectral, and temporal characteristics also varied between ICME arrival and another X-ray observation two days later. Gladstone et al. (2002) discovered the polar X-ray hot spot and found it pulsed with 45 min quasiperiodicity. During the ICME arrival, the hot spot expanded and exhibited two periods: 26 min periodicity from sulfur ions and 12 min periodicity from a mixture of carbon/sulfur and oxygen ions. After the ICME, the dominant period became 42 min. By comparing Vogt et al. (2011) Jovian mapping models with spectral analysis, we found that during ICME arrival at least two distinct ion populations, from Jupiter's dayside, produced the X-ray aurora. Auroras mapping to magnetospheric field lines between 50 and 70 RJ were dominated by emission from precipitating sulfur ions (S7+,{\ldots},14+). Emissions mapping to closed field lines between 70 and 120 RJ and to open field lines were generated by a mixture of precipitating oxygen (O7+,8+) and sulfur/carbon ions, possibly implying some solar wind precipitation. We suggest that the best explanation for the X-ray hot spot is pulsed dayside reconnection perturbing magnetospheric downward currents, as proposed by Bunce et al. (2004). The auroral enhancement has different spectral, spatial, and temporal characteristics to the hot spot. By analyzing these characteristics and coincident radio emissions, we propose that the enhancement is driven directly by the ICME through Jovian magnetosphere compression and/or a large-scale dayside reconnection event.},

abstract = {Using hydrodynamical simulations, we show for the first time that an episode of star formation in the centre of the Milky Way, with a star formation rate (SFR) ∼0.5 M⊙ yr-1 for ∼30 Myr, can produce bubbles that resemble the Fermi bubbles (FBs), when viewed from the solar position. The morphology, extent and multiwavelength observations of FBs, especially X-rays, constrain various physical parameters such as SFR, age, and the circumgalactic medium (CGM) density. We show that the interaction of the CGM with the Galactic wind driven by star formation in the central region can explain the observed surface brightness and morphological features of X-rays associated with the FBs. Furthermore, assuming that cosmic ray electrons are accelerated in situ by shocks and/or turbulence, the brightness and morphology of $\gamma$-ray emission and the microwave haze can be explained. The kinematics of the cold and warm clumps in our model also matches with recent observations of absorption lines through the bubbles.},

abstract = {We use very long baseline interferometry to measure the proper motions of three black hole X-ray binaries (BHXBs). Using these results together with data from the literature and Gaia DR2 to collate the best available constraints on proper motion, parallax, distance, and systemic radial velocity of 16 BHXBs, we determined their three-dimensional Galactocentric orbits. We extended this analysis to estimate the probability distribution for the potential kick velocity (PKV) a BHXB system could have received on formation. Constraining the kicks imparted to BHXBs provides insight into the birth mechanism of black holes (BHs). Kicks also have a significant effect on BH-BH merger rates, merger sites, and binary evolution, and can be responsible for spin-orbit misalignment in BH binary systems. 75 per cent of our systems have potential kicks > 70 km s^-1. This suggests that strong kicks and hence spin-orbit misalignment might be common among BHXBs, in agreement with the observed quasi-periodic X-ray variability in their power density spectra. We used a Bayesian hierarchical methodology to analyse the PKV distribution of the BHXB population, and suggest that a unimodal Gaussian model with a mean of 107 {\textpm} 16 km s^-1 is a statistically favourable fit. Such relatively high PKVs would also reduce the number of BHs likely to be retained in globular clusters. We found no significant correlation between the BH mass and PKV, suggesting a lack of correlation between BH mass and the BH birth mechanism. Our PYTHON code allows the estimation of the PKV for any system with sufficient observational constraints.},

abstract = {During the last few years our knowledge about the X-ray emission from bodies within the solar system has significantly improved. Several new solar system objects are now known to shine in X-rays at energies below 2 keV. Apart from the Sun, the known X-ray emitters now include planets (Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn), planetary satellites (Moon, Io, Europa, and Ganymede), all active comets, the Io plasma torus (IPT), the rings of Saturn, the coronae (exospheres) of Earth and Mars, and the heliosphere. The advent of higher-resolution X-ray spectroscopy with the Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray observatories has been of great benefit in advancing the field of planetary X-ray astronomy. Progress in modeling X-ray emission, laboratory studies of X-ray production, and theoretical calculations of cross-sections, have all contributed to our understanding of processes that produce X-rays from the solar system bodies. At Jupiter and Earth, both auroral and non-auroral disk X-ray emissions have been observed. X-rays have been detected from Saturn's disk, but no convincing evidence of an X-ray aurora has been observed. The first soft (0.1-2 keV) X-ray observation of Earth's aurora by Chandra shows that it is highly variable. The non-auroral X-ray emissions from Jupiter, Saturn, and Earth, those from the disk of Mars, Venus, and Moon, and from the rings of Saturn, are mainly produced by scattering of solar X-rays. The spectral characteristics of X-ray emission from comets, the heliosphere, the geocorona, and the Martian halo are quite similar, but they appear to be quite different from those of Jovian auroral X-rays. X-rays from the Galilean satellites and the IPT are mostly driven by impact of Jovian magnetospheric particles. This paper reviews studies of the soft X-ray emission from the solar system bodies, excluding the Sun. Processes of production of solar system X-rays are discussed and an overview is provided of the main source mechanisms of X-ray production at each object. A brief account on recent development in the area of laboratory studies of X-ray production is also provided.},

abstract = {From Kepler data, we show that the incidence of flares on stars drops by only a factor of 4 from K-M dwarfs to A-F stars. Allowing for visibility effects, this implies that the true relative number of flare stars does not change very much from cool dwarfs to hot A stars. The idea that flares on A stars can be attributed to a cool companion has to be rejected because it leads to flare amplitudes two orders of magnitude smaller than actually observed. We confirm that spots on flare stars are generally larger than those on non-flare stars and that flare stars rotate significantly faster than non-flare stars. Analysis of 209 flare stars observed in Kepler short-cadence mode allows accurate measurements of flare shapes and duration. We find that about one-third of the flares have a bump or slope discontinuity on the decaying branch and that flares of long duration are to be found in stars with low surface gravities. Flare energies are strongly correlated with stellar luminosity and radius. The correlation with radius leads to a rough estimate of several tens of gauss for the typical magnetic field associated with a flare. The correlation with stellar luminosity can be understood if the typical flare loop length-scales approximately as the stellar radius. We examined the flare frequency as a function of orbital phase in three eclipsing binaries in which a large number of flares are visible. There appears to be no correlation of flaring with orbital phase, which weakens the hypothesis that flares in close binaries could be a result of reconnection of field lines connecting the two stars.},

abstract = {The signature of positron annihilation, namely the 511 keV $\gamma$-ray line, was first detected coming from the direction of the Galactic center in the 1970's, but the source of Galactic positrons still remains a puzzle. The measured flux of the annihilation corresponds to an intense, probably steady, source of positron production, with an annihilation rate on the order of 1043{\textasciitilde}e+/s. The 511 keV emission is the strongest diffuse $\gamma$-ray line signal and it shows a concentration towards the Galactic center region. An additional low-surface brightness component is aligned with the Galactic disk; however, the morphology of the latter is not well constrained. The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a balloon-borne soft $\gamma$-ray (0.2--5 MeV) telescope designed to perform wide-field imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy. One of its major goals is to further our understanding of Galactic positrons. COSI had a 46-day balloon flight in May-July 2016 from Wanaka, New Zealand, and here we report on the detection and spectral analyses of the 511 keV emission from those observations. To isolate the Galactic positron annihilation emission from instrumental background, we have developed a technique to separate celestial signals utilizing the COMPTEL Data Space. With this method, we find a 7.2$\sigma$ detection of the 511 keV line. We find that the spatial distribution is not consistent with a single point source, and it appears to be broader than what has been previously reported.},

abstract = {From Kepler data we show that the incidence of flares on stars drops by only a factor of four from K-M dwarfs to A-F stars. Allowing for visibility effects, this implies that the true relative number of flare stars does not change very much from cool dwarfs to hot A stars. The idea that flares on A stars can be attributed to a cool companion has to be rejected because it leads to flare amplitudes two orders of magnitude smaller than actually observed. We confirm that spots on flare stars are generally larger than those on non-flare stars and that flare stars rotate significantly faster than non-flare stars. Analysis of 209 flare stars observed in Kepler short-cadence mode allow accurate measurements of flare shapes and duration. We find that about one-third of the flares have a bump or slope discontinuity on the decaying branch and that flares of long duration are to be found in stars with low surface gravities. Flare energies are strongly correlated with stellar luminosity and radius. The correlation with radius leads to a rough estimate of several tens of Gauss for the typical magnetic field associated with a flare. The correlation with stellar luminosity can be understood if the typical flare loop length scales approximately as the stellar radius. We examined the flare frequency as a function of orbital phase in three eclipsing binaries in which a large number of flares are visible. There appears no correlation of flaring with orbital phase, which weakens the hypothesis that flares in close binaries could be a result of reconnection of field lines connecting the two stars.},

abstract = {We present results based on full-mission Planck observations of temperature and polarization anisotropies of the CMB. These data are consistent with the six-parameter inflationary LCDM cosmology. From the Planck temperature and lensing data, for this cosmology we find a Hubble constant, H0= (67.8 +/- 0.9) km/s/Mpc, a matter density parameter Omega_m = 0.308 +/- 0.012 and a scalar spectral index with n_s = 0.968 +/- 0.006. (We quote 68% errors on measured parameters and 95% limits on other parameters.) Combined with Planck temperature and lensing data, Planck LFI polarization measurements lead to a reionization optical depth of tau = 0.066 +/- 0.016. Combining Planck with other astrophysical data we find N_ eff = 3.15 +/- 0.23 for the effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom and the sum of neutrino masses is constrained to < 0.23 eV. Spatial curvature is found to be |Omega_K| < 0.005. For LCDM we find a limit on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of r <0.11 consistent with the B-mode constraints from an analysis of BICEP2, Keck Array, and Planck (BKP) data. Adding the BKP data leads to a tighter constraint of r < 0.09. We find no evidence for isocurvature perturbations or cosmic defects. The equation of state of dark energy is constrained to w = -1.006 +/- 0.045. Standard big bang nucleosynthesis predictions for the Planck LCDM cosmology are in excellent agreement with observations. We investigate annihilating dark matter and deviations from standard recombination, finding no evidence for new physics. The Planck results for base LCDM are in agreement with BAO data and with the JLA SNe sample. However the amplitude of the fluctuations is found to be higher than inferred from rich cluster counts and weak gravitational lensing. Apart from these tensions, the base LCDM cosmology provides an excellent description of the Planck CMB observations and many other astrophysical data sets.},

abstract = {We present a 0.16% precise and 0.27% accurate determination of R0, the distance to the Galactic Center. Our measurement uses the star S2 on its 16-year orbit around the massive black hole Sgr A* that we followed astrometrically and spectroscopically for 27 years. Since 2017, we added near-infrared interferometry with the VLTI beam combiner GRAVITY, yielding a direct measurement of the separation vector between S2 and Sgr A* with an accuracy as good as 20 micro-arcsec in the best cases. S2 passed the pericenter of its highly eccentric orbit in May 2018, and we followed the passage with dense sampling throughout the year. Together with our spectroscopy, in the best cases with an error of 7 km/s, this yields a geometric distance estimate: R0 = 8178 +- 13(stat.) +- 22(sys.) pc. This work updates our previous publication in which we reported the first detection of the gravitational redshift in the S2 data. The redshift term is now detected with a significance level of 20 sigma with f_redshift = 1.04 +- 0.05.},

abstract = {Remote observations with the Chandra X-ray Observatory and the XMM-Newton Observatory have shown that the jovian system is a source of X-rays with a rich and complicated structure. The planet's polar auroral zones and its disk are both powerful sources of X-ray emission. Chandra observations revealed X-ray emission from the Io plasma torus and from the Galilean moons Io, Europa, and possibly Ganymede. The emission from the moons is due to bombardment of their surfaces by highly energetic magnetospheric protons, and oxygen and sulfur ions. These ions excite atoms in their surfaces leading to fluorescent X-ray emission lines. These lines are produced against an intense background continuum, including bremsstrahlung radiation from surface interactions of primary magnetospheric and secondary electrons. Although the X-ray emission from the Galilean moons is faint when observed from Earth orbit, an imaging X-ray spectrometer in orbit around one or more of these moons, operating from 200 eV to 8 keV with 150 eV energy resolution, would provide a detailed mapping of the elemental composition in their surfaces. Surface resolution of 40 m for small features could be achieved in a 100-km orbit around one moon while also remotely imaging surfaces of other moons and Jupiter's upper atmosphere at maximum regional resolutions of hundreds of kilometers. Due to its relatively more benign magnetospheric radiation environment, its intrinsic interest as the largest moon in the Solar System, and its mini-magnetosphere, Ganymede would be the ideal orbital location for long-term observational studies of the jovian system. Here we describe the physical processes leading to X-ray emission from the surfaces of Jupiter's moons and the properties required for the technique of imaging X-ray spectroscopy to map the elemental composition of their surfaces, as well as studies of the X-ray emission from the planet's aurora and disk and from the Io plasma torus.},

abstract = {The Jovian aurora is much more powerful than the terrestrial aurora, and some of the auroral energy deposition is thought to come from energetic oxygen and sulfur precipitation. Auroral oxygen and sulfur ions deposit their energy in the atmosphere by means of ionization, dissociation, and heating processes. Energetic oxygen precipitation at Jupiter was previously modeled with the lowest four charge states (O, O+, O2+, and O3+) (Horanyi et al., 1988). In this paper, the model will be extended to include all the charge states of oxygen from neutral oxygen up to fully stripped oxygen. The energy deposition by incident ions with energies in excess of about 200 keV/amu is largely determined by the higher charge states. The model extension is also needed to study auroral X ray emission by energetic highly charged ions. In this paper we estimate that a total auroral X ray power of about 108 W is produced by highly charged excited oxygen ions, which is in agreement with the X ray power observed at Jupiter by the R{\"o}ntgen satellite (ROSAT; Waite et al., 1994). We also construct a ``predicted'' X ray energy spectrum for sulfur and oxygen ions which agrees rather well with the spectrum measured by ROSAT. Our calculations support the assertion made by Waite et al. (1994) that the Jovian X ray emission observed by ROSAT can be explained by energetic ion precipitation.},

abstract = {COSI, the Compton Spectrometer and Imager, is a balloon-borne gamma-ray telescope which operates in the 0.2 to 5 MeV energy range and utilities 12 high-purity Germanium double-sided strip detectors for gamma-ray detection. In spring 2016, COSI had a very successful 46-day balloon flight from Wanaka, New Zealand using NASA{\textquoteright}s new super-pressure balloon platform which took COSI 1.5 times around the world. During the flight, COSI observed gamma-ray bursts, compact objects, the Galactic 511-keV annihilation emission, Galactic nucleosynthesis, and relativistic electron precipitation events.All-sky Compton imaging is one of the most challenging data-analysis tasks for a modern, all-sky-scanning Compton telescope. For COSI, the imaging approach needs to take into account the response of the detector as a function of energy and field-of-view position, the varying background levels throughout the balloon flight, and the varying atmospheric column density above the instrument as a function of incidence angle. Another challenge is the high-dimensional response of a Compton telescope (COSI: 5 to 8), which needs to be generated by simulations on supercomputers (COSI: cori/NERSC). Finally, the image reconstruction itself can only be performed via iterative image deconvolution approaches such as Richardson-Lucy or Maximum-Entropy.For COSI, the easiest example to test our imaging approach is the 511-keV emission from the Galactic Center and Galactic bulge region. In this presentation, we will show the latest 511-keV all-sky images as observed during the COSI 2016 balloon flight, reconstructed with different response representations and image reconstruction approaches (Richardson-Lucy, Maximum-Entropy {\&} Likelihood ratio).},

abstract = {We present measurements of the angular two-point galaxy correlation function, w(theta), from the APM Galaxy Survey. Various estimators of w are investigated using simulated galaxy catalogues and analytic arguments, and we use the estimators that are least affected by errors in the galaxy counts. An error analysis of the plate matching procedure in the APM Galaxy Survey shows that residual plate-to-plate errors bias our estimates of w by no more than {\textasciitilde}1x10^-3. A direct comparison between our photometry and external CCD photometry of over 13000 galaxies from the Las Campanas Deep Redshift Survey shows that the rms error in the APM plate zero-points lies in the range 0.04-0.05 mag, in agreement with our previous estimates. This comparison also sets tight limits on the variation of our photometry with right ascension. We find no evidence for systematic errors in the survey correlated with the date of plate scan or exposure. We find that atmospheric extinction and obscuration by dust in our Galaxy have negligible effect on w. The estimated plate-to-plate errors are independent of limiting magnitude for b_J<20. At fainter limits the star-galaxy classification becomes less reliable and plate-to-plate variations in the completeness of the survey are introduced. We use deep redshift surveys to estimate the redshift distribution of galaxies in the APM Galaxy Survey at various magnitude limits. These redshift distributions are used to predict how w should scale as a function of limiting magnitude. Our estimates of w are in excellent agreement with the expected scaling relation, providing further evidence that systematic errors in the APM survey are small. We explicitly remove large-scale structure by filtering the APM galaxy maps and conclude that there is still strong evidence for more large-scale structure than predicted by the standard scale-invariant cold dark matter (CDM) model. We compare the APM w, and the three-dimensional power spectrum derived by inverting w, with the predictions of scale-invariant CDM models. We show that the observations require Lambda=Omega_0h in the range 0.2-0.3 and are incompatible with the value Lambda=0.5 of the standard CDM model.},

abstract = {The annihilation of light dark matter was recently advocated as a possible explanation of the large positron injection rate at the Galactic center deduced from observations by the SPI spectrometer aboard INTEGRAL. The modelling of internal Bremsstrahlung and in-flight annihilation radiations associated to this process drastically reduced the mass range of this light dark matter particle. We estimate critically the various energy losses and radiations involved in the propagation of the positron before its annihilation---in-flight or at rest. Using a simple model with monoenergetic positrons injected and confined to the Galactic bulge, we compute energy losses and gamma-ray radiations caused by ionization, Bremsstrahlung interactions as well as in-flight and at rest annihilation and compare these predictions to the available observations, for various injection energies. Confronting the predictions with observations by the CGRO/EGRET, CGRO/COMPTEL, INTEGRAL/SPI, and INTEGRAL/IBIS/ISGRI instruments, we deduce a mass upper bound of 3 to 7.5  MeV/c2 for the hypothetical light dark matter particle. The most restrictive limit is in agreement with the value previously found by Beacom and Y\"uksel and was obtained under similar assumptions, while the 7.5  MeV/c2 value corresponds to more conservative choices and to a partially ionized propagation medium. We stress how the limit depends on the degree of ionization of the propagation medium and how its precision could be improved by a better appraisal of data uncertainties.},

Two different mapping methods, singular value decomposition and maximum entropy, have been applied to the data. In both cases, the resulting maps show evidence for three distinct features: (1) a central bulge, (2) emission in the Galactic plane, and (3) an enhancement or extension of emission at positive latitudes above the Galactic center. Modeling of the data confirmed the existence of these features. The derived distribution is found to be in good qualitative agreement with nearly all of the historical observations of narrow 511 keV line emission from the Galactic center region. No evidence of time variability is found. Various possible production mechanisms for the observed positrons, including the positive-latitude enhancement, are presented. It is found that supernovae are capable of producing positrons at the required rate to account for the intensity and morphology of the observed 511 keV line emission.},

We find that the nuclear outflows inflate a genuine bubble in each Galactic hemisphere that has the classical structure, working outward, of reverse shock, contact discontinuity (CD), and forward shock. Expanding into the finite pressure of the halo and given appreciable cooling and gravitational losses, the CD of each bubble is now expanding only very slowly. We find observational signatures in both hemispheres of giant, reverse shocks at heights of ∼1 kpc above the nucleus; their presence ultimately explains all three of the nonthermal phenomena mentioned above. Synchrotron emission from shock-reaccelerated cosmic-ray electrons explains the spectrum, morphology, and vertical extent of the microwave haze and the polarized radio lobes. Collisions between shock-reaccelerated hadrons and denser gas in cooling condensations that form inside the CD account for most of the bubbles{\textquoteright} $\gamma$-ray emissivity. Inverse Compton emission from primary electrons contributes at the 10%-30% level. Our model suggests that the bubbles are signatures of a comparatively weak but sustained nuclear outflow driven by Galactic center star formation over ≳few {\texttimes} 108 yr.},

An iterative light curve de-trending approach was used to filter out both astrophysical and systematic variability to detect flares. The flare recovery completeness has also been computed throughout each light curve using artificial flare injection tests, and the tools for this work have been made publicly available. The final sample contains 851,168 candidate flare events recovered above the 68% completeness threshold, which were detected from 4041 stars, or 1.9% of the stars in the Kepler database. The average flare energy detected is ∼1035 erg. The net fraction of flare stars increases with g - I color, or decreasing stellar mass. For stars in this sample with previously measured rotation periods, the total relative flare luminosity is compared to the Rossby number. A tentative detection of flare activity saturation for low-mass stars with rapid rotation below a Rossby number of ∼0.03 is found. A power-law decay in flare activity with Rossby number is found with a slope of -1, shallower than typical measurements for X-ray activity decay with Rossby number.},

These power estimates are based on an assumed emission wavelength of 574 eV (corresponding to a bright emission line of OVII ions), and are subject to revision as Chandra ACIS spectra of Jupiter are analyzed further. We will present these and other results from this unique data set.},

abstract = {A new series of Earth occultation observations has been started in 2012 to refine the determination of the cosmic X-ray background by the INTEGRAL mission. We show here that the new detector lightcurves in the 3 to 160 keV range differ from the ones obtained in 2006. Instead of the expected modulation induced by the passage of the Earth through the field of view of the JEM-X, IBIS/ISGRI and SPI instruments, we record unrelated variability on shorter timescales. We discuss the differences obtained with the datasets of 2006 and 2012 in view of the changes in pointing direction, spacecraft orbit and solar cycle phase. We conclude that the Earth occultation signal in 2012 is likely blended by radioactive decay resulting from the activation of the spacecraft when crossing the proton radiation belt at perigee passage. The observed variability, on the other hand, results most likely from the current solar maximum. In addition to a variable particle environment from inhomogeneities of the solar wind, we also find evidence for hard X-ray auroral emission. While the former can be traced by SPI/ACS counts, the latter - by enhancing unpredictably the Earth emission - is a major disturbance for measuring the diffuse X-ray background through occultation by the Earth.},

abstract = {We present results of a study of the Galactic ridge X-ray emission (GRXE) in hard X-rays performed with the IBIS telescope aboard INTEGRAL. The imaging capabilities of this coding aperture telescope make it possible to account for the flux from bright Galactic point sources whereas the wide field of view permits us to collect large flux from the underlying GRXE. Extensive study of the IBIS/ISGRI detector background allowed us to construct a model that predicts the detector count rate with 1-2% accuracy in the energy band 17-60 keV. The derived longitude and latitude profiles of the ridge emission are in good agreement with the Galactic distribution of stars obtained from infrared observations. This, along with the measured hard X-ray spectrum of the Galactic ridge emission strongly indicates its stellar origin. The derived unit stellar mass emissivity of the ridge in the energy band 17-60 keV, (0.9-1.2) {\texttimes} 10<SUP>27</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> M<SUP>-1</SUP><SUB>☉</SUB> (assuming a bulge mass of 1-1.3 {\texttimes} 10<SUP>10</SUP> M_☉), agrees with that of local (in the Solar neigborhood) accreting magnetic white dwarf binaries - dominant contributors to the GRXE at these energies. In addition, the shape of the obtained GRXE spectrum can be used to determine the average mass of white dwarfs in such systems in the Galaxy as 0.5 M<SUB>☉</SUB>. The total hard X-ray luminosity of the GRXE is L_17{-60 keV} =(3.7{\textpm}0.2) {\texttimes} 10<SUP>37</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> in the 17-60 keV band. At energies 70-200 keV no additional contribution to the total emission of the Galaxy apart from the detected point sources is seen. <P />Based on observations with INTEGRAL, an ESA project with an instrument and science data center funded by ESA member states (especially the PI countries: Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Spain), The Czech Republic, and Poland, and with the participation of Russia and the USA.},

abstract = {Data from the Far Ultraviolet Instrument (FUV) on the IMAGE spacecraft and the Polar Ionospheric X-ray Imaging Experiment (PIXIE) and the Ultraviolet Imager (UVI) on board the Polar satellite are used to derive the energy distribution of precipitating particles during substorms. While the ultraviolet imagers can be used to estimate the distributions below {\textasciitilde}30-50 keV the X-ray measurements provide information about the electrons up to 100 keV. We estimate the global energy deposition rate (UA) by auroral electrons in the northern hemisphere using data from the different imagers. By deriving the UA from ultraviolet emissions only we find that about 90-100 % of the total energy flux will be estimated during growth phase and expansion phase. However, due to the hard tail above 20-30 keV in the electron spectrum frequently observed during recovery phase only about 80% of the total energy flux will be estimated when only UV emissions are used to estimate UA. Using the time-shifted solar wind measurements (WIND satellite) we calculate the total available kinetic energy in the solar wind (USW) and the predicted energy transport due to merging (epsilon-parameter) prior to and during 7 substorms. Using geomagnetic indices (Dst and AE) we estimate the energy increase of the ring current (UR) and the Joule heating in both hemispheres (UJ). Knowing the most important energy sources and sinks for the magnetospheric-ionospheric (MI) system, we present the energy budget for these substorms. We find that a viscous interaction that transfers 0.15% of the USW in addition to the energy transferred by the epsilon-parameter is sufficient to balance the total energy dissipation UT (=UA+U_R+U_J)},

The enhanced spatial and temporal resolution of the solar observation satellite Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) has made it possible to study these structures in fine detail. IRIS has observed {\textquoteleft}transient brightenings{\textquoteright} in these loops, associated with strong excess line broadenings1,2 providing important clues to the mechanisms that heat the solar atmosphere. However, the physical origin of the brightenings is debated. The line broadenings have been variously interpreted as signatures of nanoflares3, magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence4, plasmoid instabilities5 and magneto-acoustic shocks6. Here we use IRIS slit-jaw images and spectral data, and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly of the Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft, to show that the brightenings are consistent with magnetic-reconnection-mediated impulsive heating at field-line braiding sites in multi-stranded transition-region loops. The spectroscopic observations present evidence for preferential heating of heavy ions from the transition region and we show that this is consistent with ion cyclotron turbulence caused by strong currents at the reconnection sites. Time-dependent differential emission measure distributions are used to determine the heating frequency7{\textendash}9 and to identify pockets of faintly emitting {\textquoteleft}super-hot{\textquoteright} plasma. The observations we present and the techniques we demonstrate open up a new avenue of diagnostics for reconnection-mediated energy release in solar plasma.},

abstract = {Aims: We want to estimate whether the positrons produced by the $\beta$+-decay of 26Al, 44Ti, and 56Ni synthesised in massive stars and supernovae are sufficient to explain the 511 keV annihilation emission observed in our Galaxy. Such a possibility has often been put forward in the past. In a previous study, we showed that nucleosynthesis positrons cannot explain the full annihilation emission. Here, we extend this work using an improved propagation model. Methods: We developed a Monte Carlo Galactic propagation code for {\textasciitilde}MeV positrons in which the Galactic interstellar medium, the Galactic magnetic field, and the propagation are finely described. This code allows us to simulate the spatial distribution of the 511 keV annihilation emission. We tested several Galactic magnetic fields models and several positron escape fractions from type-Ia supernova for 56Ni positrons to account for the large uncertainties in these two parameters. We considered the collisional/ballistic transport mode and then compared the simulated 511 keV intensity spatial distributions to the INTEGRAL/SPI data. Results: Regardless of the Galactic magnetic field configuration and the escape fraction chosen for 56Ni positrons, the 511 keV intensity distributions are very similar. The main reason is that {\textasciitilde}MeV positrons do not propagate very far away from their birth sites in our model. The direct comparison to the data does not allow us to constrain the Galactic magnetic field configuration and the escape fraction for 56Ni positrons. In any case, nucleosynthesis positrons produced in steady state cannot explain the full annihilation emission. The comparison to the data shows that (a) the annihilation emission from the Galactic disk can be accounted for; (b) the strongly peaked annihilation emission from the inner Galactic bulge can be explained by positrons annihilating in the central molecular zone, but this seems to require more positron sources than the population of massive stars and type Ia supernovae usually assumed for this region; (c) the more extended emission from the Galactic bulge cannot be explained. We show that a delayed 511 keV emission from a transient source, such as a starburst episode or a recent activity of Sgr A*, occurring between 0.3 and 10 Myr ago and producing between 1057 and 1060 sub-MeV positrons could explain this extended component, and potentially contribute to the inner bulge signal.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, extensive studies have been undertaken to search for photon signals from dark matter annihilation or decay for dark matter particle masses above {\textasciitilde}1 GeV. However, due to the lacking sensitivity of current experiments at MeV-GeV energies, sometimes dubbed the 'MeV gap', dark matter models with MeV to sub-GeV particle masses have received little attention so far. Various proposed MeV missions (like, e.g., e-ASTROGAM or AMEGO) are aimed at closing this gap in the mid- or long-term future. This, and the absence of clear dark matter signals in the GeV-TeV range, makes it relevant to carefully reconsider the expected experimental instrumental sensitivities in this mass range. The most common two-body annihilation channels for sub-GeV dark matter are to neutrinos, electrons, pions or directly to photons. Among these, only the electron channel has been extensively studied, and almost exclusively in the context of the 511 keV line. In this work, we study the prospects for detecting MeV dark matter annihilation in general in future MeV missions, using e-ASTROGAM as reference, and focusing on dark matter masses in the range 1 MeV-3 GeV. In the case of leptonic annihilation, we emphasise the importance of the often overlooked bremsstrahlung and in-flight annihilation spectral features, which in many cases provide the dominant gamma-ray signal in this regime.},

abstract = {Recent measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies by Planck provide a sensitive probe of dark matter annihilation during the cosmic dark ages, and specifically constrain the annihilation parameter feff{\textlangle}$\sigma$ v {\textrangle}/m$\chi$. Using new results (paper II) for the ionization produced by particles injected at arbitrary energies, we calculate and provide feff values for photons and e+e- pairs injected at keV-TeV energies; the feff value for any dark matter model can be obtained straightforwardly by weighting these results by the spectrum of annihilation products. This result allows the sensitive and robust constraints on dark matter annihilation presented by the Planck collaboration to be applied to arbitrary dark matter models with s -wave annihilation. We demonstrate the validity of this approach using principal component analysis. As an example, we integrate over the spectrum of annihilation products for a range of Standard Model final states to determine the CMB bounds on these models as a function of dark matter mass, and demonstrate that the new limits generically exclude models proposed to explain the observed high-energy rise in the cosmic ray positron fraction. We make our results publicly available at http://nebel.rc.fas.harvard.edu/epsilon.},

abstract = {We calculate many different nova light curves for a variety of white dwarf masses and chemical compositions, with the assumption that free-free emission from optically thin ejecta dominates the continuum flux. We show that all these light curves are homologous and a universal law can be derived by introducing a ``time scaling factor.'' The template light curve for the universal law has a slope of flux F{\textasciitilde}t-1.75 in the middle part (from {\textasciitilde}2 to {\textasciitilde}6 mag below the optical maximum), but it declines more steeply, F{\textasciitilde}t-3.5, in the later part (from {\textasciitilde}6 to {\textasciitilde}10 mag), where t is the time from the outburst in units of days. This break on the light curve is due to a quick decrease in the wind mass-loss rate. The nova evolutions are approximately scaled by the time of break. Once the time of break is observationally determined, we can derive the period of a UV burst phase, the duration of optically thick wind phase, and the turnoff date of hydrogen shell-burning. An empirical observational formula, t3=(1.68+/-0.08) t2+(1.9+/-1.5) days, is derived from the relation of F{\textasciitilde}t-1.75, where t2 and t3 are the times in days during which a nova decays by 2 and 3 mag from the optical maximum, respectively. We have applied our template light curve model to the three well-observed novae, V1500 Cyg, V1668 Cyg, and V1974 Cyg. Our theoretical light curves show excellent agreement with the optical y and infrared J, H, K light curves. The continuum UV 1455 {\AA} light curves observed with IUE are well reproduced. The turn-on and turn-off of supersoft X-ray observed with ROSAT are also explained simultaneously by our model. The WD mass is estimated, from the light curve fitting, to be MWD{\textasciitilde}1.15 Msolar for V1500 Cyg, MWD{\textasciitilde}0.95 Msolar for V1668 Cyg, and MWD{\textasciitilde}0.95-1.05 Msolar for V1974 Cyg, together with the appropriate chemical compositions of the ejecta.},

At the same time, if not well understood, such emissions may be annoying backgrounds for dark matter searches. Therefore, it is crucial to model them as better as possible. We do that by combining simulations of the CR propagation with recent models of the gas distribution. Respect to previous works, we perform a treatment of CR diffusion which accounts for a more realistic spatial dependence of the diffusion coefficients. Although our analysis is focused on the energy range above the TeV, we can reliably extrapolate our predictions at lower energies and compare them with EGRET measurements finding a good agreement. Then, we compare our predictions with MILAGRO and TIBET observations in several regions of the sky, including Cygnus and the Galactic Centre. Finally, we briefly discuss the implication of our finding for neutrino astronomy.},

abstract = {Black-hole-neutron-star mergers resulting in the disruption of the neutron star and the formation of an accretion disk and/or the ejection of unbound material are prime candidates for the joint detection of gravitational-wave and electromagnetic signals when the next generation of gravitational-wave detectors comes online. However, the disruption of the neutron star and the properties of the postmerger remnant are very sensitive to the parameters of the binary (mass ratio, black-hole spin, neutron star radius). In this paper, we study the impact of the radius of the neutron star and the alignment of the black-hole spin on black-hole-neutron-star mergers within the range of mass ratio currently deemed most likely for field binaries (MBH{\~{ }}7MNS) and for black-hole spins large enough for the neutron star to disrupt (JBH/MBH2=0.9). We find that (i) In this regime, the merger is particularly sensitive to the radius of the neutron star, with remnant masses varying from 0.3MNS to 0.1MNS for changes of only 2 km in the NS radius; (ii) 0.01M⊙-0.05M⊙ of unbound material can be ejected with kinetic energy ≳1051ergs, a significant increase compared to low mass ratio, low spin binaries. This ejecta could power detectable postmerger optical and radio afterglows. (iii) Only a small fraction of the Advanced LIGO events in this parameter range have gravitational-wave signals which could offer constraints on the equation of state of the neutron star (at best {\~{ }}3% of the events for a single detector at design sensitivity). (iv) A misaligned black-hole spin works against disk formation, with less neutron-star material remaining outside of the black hole after merger, and a larger fraction of that material remaining in the tidal tail instead of the forming accretion disk. (v) Large kicks vkick≳300km/s can be given to the final black hole as a result of a precessing black-hole-neutron-star merger, when the disruption of the neutron star occurs just outside or within the innermost stable spherical orbit.},

abstract = {Based on the initial data sets taken with the ISO short wavelength spectrometer (SWS) we present a first discussion of the source of luminosity of (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). By comparison of observations of 2.5-45$\mu$m lines to classical starbursts and active galactic nuclei and by modelling of the line emission we show that three key representatives of this class, Arp 220, NGC 6240 and NGC 3256 are likely powered mainly by recently formed, massive stars. While an active nucleus may well be present in anyone of these sources, ratios of fine structure lines in different stages of ionization show that most of the luminosity is in a relatively soft, `stellar' ultraviolet radiation field. Starburst models with stars of masses up to 50-100Msun_ successfully account for the observations with an extended burst phase of 1 to 2x10^7^ years and burst ages between 2 and 7x10^7^ years. Our analysis indicates that previous optical and near-infrared analyses were strongly hampered by the very large extinctions in these galaxies.},

abstract = {The International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (I N T E G R A L ) satellite has yielded unprecedented measurements of the soft gamma-ray spectrum of our Galaxy. Here we use those measurements to set constraints on dark matter (DM) that decays or annihilates into photons with energies E $\approx$0.02 - 2 MeV . First, we revisit the constraints on particle DM that decays or annihilates to photon pairs. In particular, for decaying DM, we find that previous limits were overstated by roughly an order of magnitude. Our new, conservative analysis finds that the DM lifetime must satisfy $\tau$ ≳5 {\texttimes}1026 s {\texttimes}(m$\chi$/MeV )-1 for DM masses m$\chi$=0.054 - 3.6 MeV . For MeV-scale DM that annihilates into photons I N T E G R A L sets the strongest constraints to date. Second, we target ultralight primordial black holes (PBHs) through their Hawking radiation. This makes them appear as decaying DM with a photon spectrum peaking at E $\approx$5.77 /(8 $\pi$ G MPBH), for a PBH of mass MPBH. We use the I N T E G R A L data to demonstrate that, at 95% C.L., PBHs with masses less than 1.2 {\texttimes}1017 g cannot comprise all of the DM, setting the tightest bound to date on ultralight PBHs.},

abstract = {We report on studies of classical nova (CN) explosions where we follow the evolution of thermonuclear runaways (TNRs) on carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (WDs). We vary both the mass of the WD (from 0.6 M⊙ to 1.35 M⊙) and the composition of the accreted material. Our simulations are guided by the results of multidimensional studies of TNRs in WDs, which find that sufficient mixing with WD core material occurs after the TNR is well underway, and levels of enrichment are reached that agree with observations of CN ejecta abundances. We use NOVA (our one-dimensional hydrodynamic code) to accrete solar matter until the TNR is ongoing and then switch to a mixed composition (either 25% WD material and 75% solar or 50% WD material and 50% solar). Because the amount of accreted material is inversely proportional to the initial 12C abundance, by first accreting solar matter the amount of material taking part in the outburst is larger than in those simulations where we assume a mixed composition from the beginning. Our results show large enrichments of 7Be in the ejected gases, implying that CO CNe may be responsible for a significant fraction (∼100 M⊙) of the 7Li in the galaxy (∼1000 M⊙). Although the ejected gases are enriched in WD material, the WDs in these simulations eject less material than they accrete. We predict that the WD is growing in mass as a consequence of the accretion-outburst-accretion cycle, and CO CNe may be an important channel for SN Ia progenitors.},

abstract = {We report the detection of hard (> 10 keV) X-ray emission from Jupiter with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR). NuSTAR is the first hard X-ray telescope with sufficient angular resolution (18" FWHM) to remotely resolve the planet. Previous observations with the Ulysses spacecraft had only produced an upper limit on the hard X-ray emission. We carried out a large NuSTAR observation campaign from 2015 to 2018 with 590 ksec total exposure. These NuSTAR observations coincided with one Juno apojove (in June 2017) and three perijoves (in May, July 2017 and April 2018). The observations were coordinated with the Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray telescopes and HST. NuSTAR detected hard X-ray emission from both the north and south aurorae, which is an extension of the non-thermal electron bremsstrahlung component detected up to 7 keV by XMM-Newton [Branduardi-Raymont et al. 2007]. Broad-band (3-40 keV) X-ray continuum spectra of the Jovian aurorae from NuSTAR, combined with the simultaneous XMM-Newton observations, are well characterized by a power-law model with a very hard photon index ($\Gamma$ {\textasciitilde} 1) and a spectral cutoff above {\textasciitilde}20 keV, required to be consistent with the Ulysses upper limits. Most intriguingly, NuSTAR observed that hard X-ray emission from the south aurora was consistently brighter than its counterpart in the north, whereas soft X-ray emission below 2 keV (where the emission lines from precipitating ions are predominant) is brighter in the north aurora [Gladstone et al. 2002]. We probe the anisotropic hard X-ray emission between the two aurorae using a 3D particle injection simulation tool which incorporates the magnetic field data obtained by Juno's MAG instrument [Moore et al. 2018]. We also present our investigation of whether the electron energy spectra measured in-situ by Juno's JADE/JEDI instruments can account for the X-ray spectra observed by NuSTAR and XMM-Newton.},

abstract = {Context. A number of novae have been found to emit high-energy gamma rays (>100 MeV). However, the origin of this emission is not yet understood. We report on the search for gamma-ray emission from 75 optically detected Galactic novae in the first 7.4 years of operation of the Fermi Large Area Telescope using the Pass 8 data set. Aims: We compile an optical nova catalog including light curves from various resources and estimate the optical peak time and optical peak magnitude in order to search for gamma-ray emission to determine whether all novae are gamma-ray emitters. Methods: We repeated the analysis of the six novae previously identified as gamma-ray sources and developed a unified analysis strategy that we then applied to all novae in our catalog. We searched for emission in a 15 day time window in two-day steps ranging from 20 days before to 20 days after the optical peak time. We performed a population study with Monte Carlo simulations to set constraints on the properties of the gamma-ray emission of novae. Results: Two new novae candidates have been found at 2$\sigma$ global significance. Although these two novae candidates were not detected at a significant level individually, taking them together with the other non-detected novae, we found a sub-threshold nova population with a cumulative 3$\sigma$ significance. We report the measured gamma-ray flux for detected sources and flux upper limits for novae without significant detection. Our results can be reproduced by several gamma-ray emissivity models (e.g., a power-law distribution with a slope of 2), while a constant emissivity model (i.e., assuming novae are standard candles) can be rejected.},

abstract = {Aims. We seek to understand the propagation mechanisms of positrons in the interstellar medium (ISM). This understanding is a key to determine whether the spatial distribution of the annihilation emission observed in our Galaxy reflects the spatial distribution of positron sources and, therefore, makes it possible to place constraints on the origin of positrons. Methods: We review the different processes that are likely to affect the transport of positrons in the ISM. These processes fall into three broad categories: scattering off magnetohydrodynamic waves, collisions with particles of the interstellar gas, and advection with large-scale fluid motions. We assess the efficiency of each process and describe its impact on the propagation of positrons. We also develop a model of positron propagation, based on Monte-Carlo simulations, which enable us to estimate the distances traveled by positrons in the different phases of the ISM. Results: We find that low-energy (⪉10 MeV) positrons generally have negligible interactions with magnetohydrodynamic waves, insofar as these waves are heavily damped. Positron propagation is mainly controlled by collisions with gas particles. Under these circumstances, positrons can travel very large distances (up to ∼30 kpc/n_H,cm-3 for 1 MeV positrons) along magnetic field lines before annihilating.},

abstract = {Context. Significant progress has been made in recent years to understand the formation and evolution of our Galaxy, but we still lack a complete understanding of the Galaxy and its structure. Aims: Using an almost complete sample of Galactic open star clusters within 1.8 kpc, we aim to understand the general properties of the open cluster system in the Galaxy and probe the Galactic structure. Methods: We first extracted 1241 open clusters within 1.8 kpc of the Sun from the Milky Way Star Clusters (MWSC) catalog. Considering it an almost complete sample of clusters within this distance, we performed a comprehensive statistical analysis of various cluster parameters such as spatial position, age, size, mass, and extinction. Results: We find an average cluster scale height of zh = 60 {\textpm} 2 pc for clusters younger than 700 Myr, which increases to 64 {\textpm} 2 pc when we include all the clusters. The zh is found to be strongly dependent on RGC and age, and on an average, zh is more than twice as large as in the outer region than in the inner region of the solar circle, except for the youngest population of clusters. The solar offset is found to be 6.2 {\textpm} 1.1 pc above the formal Galactic plane. We derive a local mass density of $\rho$0 = 0.090 {\textpm} 0.005 M⊙/ pc3 and estimate a negligibly small amount of dark matter in the solar neighborhood. The reddening in the direction of clusters suggests a strong correlation with their vertical distance from the Galactic plane with a respective slope of dE(B-V) / dz = 0.40 {\textpm} 0.04 and 0.42 {\textpm} 0.05 mag/kpc below and above the Galactic plane. We observe a linear mass-radius and mass-age relations in the open clusters and derive the slopes of dR/ d(log M) = 2.08 {\textpm} 0.10 and d(log M) / d(log T) = -0.36 {\textpm} 0.05, respectively. Conclusions: The dependence of the spatial distribution of clusters on their age points to a complex interplay between cluster formation and survivability within the Galaxy. The geometrical characteristics of a significant number of clusters enabled us to understand large-scale spatial properties of the cluster systems within the Galaxy. The structural and physical parameters of clusters allowed us to check mutual correlations between the individual parameters.

abstract = {We search for excess $\gamma$-ray emission coincident with the positions of confirmed and candidate Milky Way satellite galaxies using six years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT). Our sample of 45 stellar systems includes 28 kinematically confirmed dark-matter-dominated dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and 17 recently discovered systems that have photometric characteristics consistent with the population of known dSphs. For each of these targets, the relative predicted $\gamma$-ray flux due to dark matter annihilation is taken from kinematic analysis if available, and estimated from a distance-based scaling relation otherwise, assuming that the stellar systems are DM-dominated dSphs. LAT data coincident with four of the newly discovered targets show a slight preference (each ∼ 2$\sigma$ local) for $\gamma$-ray emission in excess of the background. However, the ensemble of derived $\gamma$-ray flux upper limits for individual targets is consistent with the expectation from analyzing random blank-sky regions, and a combined analysis of the population of stellar systems yields no globally significant excess (global significance < 1$\sigma$ ). Our analysis has increased sensitivity compared to the analysis of 15 confirmed dSphs by Ackermann et al. The observed constraints on the DM annihilation cross section are statistically consistent with the background expectation, improving by a factor of ∼2 for large DM masses ({m}{DM,b\bar{b}}≳ 1 {TeV} and {m}{DM,{$\tau$ }+{$\tau$ }-}≳ 70 {GeV}) and weakening by a factor of ∼1.5 at lower masses relative to previously observed limits.},

abstract = {The 511 keV line from positron annihilation in the Galaxy was the first gamma-ray line detected to originate from outside our solar system. Going into the fifth decade since the discovery, the source of positrons is still unconfirmed and remains one of the enduring mysteries in gamma-ray astronomy. With a large flux of {\textasciitilde}10-3 ph/cm2/s, after 15 years in operation INTEGRAL/SPI has detected the 511 keV line at >50$\sigma$ and has performed high-resolution spectral studies which conclude that Galactic positrons predominantly annihilate at low energies in warm phases of the interstellar medium. The results from imaging are less certain, but show a spatial distribution with a strong concentration in the center of the Galaxy. The observed emission from the Galactic disk has low surface brightness and the scale height is poorly constrained, therefore, the shear number of annihilating positrons in our Galaxy is still not well know. Positrons produced in $\beta$+ decay of nucleosynthesis products, such as 26Al, can account for some of the annihilation emission in the disk, but the observed spatial distribution, in particular the excess in the Galactic bulge, remains difficult to explain. Additionally, one of the largest uncertainties in these studies is the unknown distance that positrons propagate before annihilation. In this presentation, we will summarize the current knowledge base of Galactic positrons, and discuss how next-generation instruments such as AMEGO and COSI could finally provide the answers.},

abstract = {Context. The detection and measurement of gamma-ray lines from the decay chain of 56Ni provides unique information about the explosion in supernovae. SN2014J at 3.3 Mpc is a sufficiently-nearby supernova of type Ia so that such measurements have been feasible with the gamma-ray spectrometer SPI on ESA's INTEGRAL gamma-ray observatory. Aims: The 56Ni freshly produced in the supernova is understood to power the optical light curve, because it emits gamma rays upon its radioactive decay first to 56Co and then to 56Fe. Gamma-ray lines from 56Co decay are expected to become directly visible through the white dwarf material several weeks after the explosion, as they progressively penetrate the overlying material of the supernova envelope, which is diluted as it expands. The lines are expected to be Doppler-shifted or broadened from the kinematics of the 56Ni ejecta. We aim to exploit high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy with the SPI spectrometer on INTEGRAL toward constraining the 56Ni distribution and kinematics in this supernova. Methods: We use the observations with the SPI spectrometer on INTEGRAL, together with an improved instrumental background method. Results: We detect the two main lines from 56Co decay at 847 and 1238 keV, which are significantly Doppler-broadened, and at intensities (3.65 {\textpm} 1.21) {\texttimes} 10-4 and (2.27 {\textpm} 0.69) {\texttimes} 10-4 ph cm-2 s-1, respectively, at their brightness maximum. We measure their rise toward a maximum after about 60-100 days and a decline thereafter. The intensity ratio of the two lines is found to be consistent with expectations from 56Co decay (0.62 {\textpm} 0.28 at brightness maximum, the expected ratio is 0.68). We find that the broad lines seen in the late, gamma-ray transparent phase are not representative of the early gamma-ray emission, and notice instead that the emission spectrum is complex and irregular until the supernova is fully transparent to gamma rays, with progressive uncovering of the bulk of 56Ni. We infer that the explosion morphology is not spherically symmetric, both in the distribution of 56Ni and in the unburnt material which occults the 56Co emission. After we compare light curves from different plausible models, the resulting 56Ni mass is determined to be 0.49 {\textpm} 0.09 M⊙.},

abstract = {Context. The space based $\gamma$-ray observatory INTEGRAL of the European Space Agency (ESA) includes the spectrometer instrument "SPI". This is a coded mask telescope featuring a 19-element Germanium detector array for high-resolution $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy, encapsulated in a scintillation detector assembly that provides a veto for background from charged particles. In space, cosmic rays irradiate spacecraft and instruments, which, in spite of the vetoing detectors, results in a large instrumental background from activation of those materials, and leads to deterioration of the charge collection properties of the Ge detectors. Aim. We aim to determine the measurement characteristics of our detectors and their evolution with time, that is, their spectral response and instrumental background. These incur systematic variations in the SPI signal from celestial photons, hence their determination from a broad empirical database enables a reduction of underlying systematics in data analysis. For this, we explore compromises balancing temporal and spectral resolution within statistical limitations. Our goal is to enable modelling of background applicable to spectroscopic studies of the sky, accounting separately for changes of the spectral response and of instrumental background. Methods: We use 13.5 years of INTEGRAL/SPI data, which consist of spectra for each detector and for each pointing of the satellite. Spectral fits to each such spectrum, with independent but coherent treatment of continuum and line backgrounds, provides us with details about separated background components. From the strongest background lines, we first determine how the spectral response changes with time. Applying symmetry and long-term stability tests, we eliminate degeneracies and reduce statistical fluctuations of background parameters, with the aim of providing a self-consistent description of the spectral response for each individual detector. Accounting for this, we then determine how the instrumental background components change in intensities and other characteristics, most-importantly their relative distribution among detectors. Results: Spectral resolution of Ge detectors in space degrades with time, up to 15% within half a year, consistently for all detectors, and across the SPI energy range. Semi-annual annealing operations recover these losses, yet there is a small long-term degradation. The intensity of instrumental background varies anti-correlated to solar activity, in general. There are significant differences among different lines and with respect to continuum. Background lines are found to have a characteristic, well-defined and long-term consistent intensity ratio among detectors. We use this to categorise lines in groups of similar behaviour. The dataset of spectral-response and background parameters as fitted across the INTEGRAL mission allows studies of SPI spectral response and background behaviour in a broad perspective, and efficiently supports precision modelling of instrumental background.},

abstract = {Context. The formation processes and the evolutionary stages of high-mass stars are poorly understood compared to low-mass stars. Large-scale surveys are needed to provide an unbiased census of high column density sites that can potentially host precursors to high-mass stars. Aims: The ATLASGAL survey covers 420 sq. degree of the Galactic plane, between -80{\textdegree} < $\ell$ < +60{\textdegree} at 870 $\mu$m. Here we identify the population of embedded sources throughout the inner Galaxy. With this catalog we first investigate the general statistical properties of dust condensations in terms of their observed parameters, such as flux density and angular size. Then using mid-infrared surveys we aim to investigate their star formation activity and the Galactic distribution of star-forming and quiescent clumps. Our ultimate goal is to determine the statistical properties of quiescent and star-forming clumps within the Galaxy and to constrain the star formation processes. Methods: We optimized the source extraction method, referred to as MRE-GCL, for the ATLASGAL maps in order to generate a catalog of compact sources. This technique is based on multiscale filtering to remove extended emission from clouds to better determine the parameters corresponding to the embedded compact sources. In a second step we extracted the sources by fitting 2D Gaussians with the Gaussclumps algorithm. Results: We have identified in total 10861 compact submillimeter sources with fluxes above 5$\sigma$. Completeness tests show that this catalog is 97% complete above 5$\sigma$ and >99% complete above 7$\sigma$. Correlating this sample of clumps with mid-infrared point source catalogs (MSX at 21.3 $\mu$m and WISE at 22 $\mu$m), we have determined a lower limit of 33% that is associated with embedded protostellar objects. We note that the proportion of clumps associated with mid-infrared sources increases with increasing flux density, achieving a rather constant fraction of {\textasciitilde}75% of all clumps with fluxes over 5 Jy/beam being associated with star formation. Examining the source counts as a function of Galactic longitude, we are able to identify the most prominent star-forming regions in the Galaxy. Conclusions: We present here the compact source catalog of the full ATLASGAL survey and investigate their characteristic properties. From the fraction of the likely massive quiescent clumps ({\textasciitilde}25%), we estimate a formation time scale of {\textasciitilde} 7.5 {\textpm} 2.5 {\texttimes} 104 yr for the deeply embedded phase before the emergence of luminous young stellar objects. Such a short duration for the formation of high-mass stars in massive clumps clearly proves that the earliest phases have to be dynamic with supersonic motions.

abstract = {Author(s): Kierans, Carolyn | Advisor(s): Boggs, Steven E | Abstract: The signature of positron annihilation, namely the 511{\textasciitilde}keV $\gamma$-ray line, was first detected coming from the direction of the Galactic center in the 1970's, but the source of Galactic positrons still remains a puzzle. The measured flux of the annihilation corresponds to an intense steady source of positron production, with an annihilation rate of 1043{\textasciitilde}e^+/s. Spatially, the 511{\textasciitilde}keV intensity is strongest in the Galactic center region, with an additional component that is consistent with the Galactic disk; however, the unique morphology is not well constrained.The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a balloon-borne soft $\gamma$-ray (0.2--5{\textasciitilde}MeV) telescope designed to perform wide-field imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy, with a goal of furthering our understanding of Galactic positrons. COSI employs a compact Compton telescope design, using 12 cross-strip germanium detectors to track the trajectory of incident photons, where position and energy deposits from Compton interactions allow for a reconstruction of the source sky position and significant background reduction. COSI had a record-breaking 46-day balloon flight from Wanaka, New Zealand, in May--July 2016, and here we report on the detection and analyses of the 511{\textasciitilde}keV emission from those observations. To isolate the Galactic positron annihilation emission, we have developed a background subtraction technique utilizing the COMPTEL Data Space. With this new method, we find a 7.2{\textasciitilde}$\sigma$ detection of the 511{\textasciitilde} line and a broader spatial distribution of the emission than has been previously reported.},

abstract = {The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a balloon-borne gamma-ray (0.2-5 MeV) telescope designed to study astrophysical sources. COSI's main science goals are to measure polarization from gamma-ray bursts and compact objects, map the 511-keV positron annihilation line from the Galactic bulge and plane, and image diffuse Galactic emission with nuclear lines. COSI employs a compact Compton telescope design utilizing 12 high-purity germanium double-sided strip detectors and is inherently sensitive to polarization. In 2016, COSI was launched from Wanaka, New Zealand and completed a successful 46-day flight on NASA's new Superpressure balloon. In order to perform imaging, spectral, and polarization analysis of the sources observed during the 2016 flight, we must accurately simulate the detector response. To achieve this goal, we have built a comprehensive mass model of the instrument and developed a detailed detector effects engine which applies the intrinsic detector performance to Monte Carlo simulations. The simulated detector effects include energy, position, and timing resolution, thresholds, dead strips, dead time, and detector trigger conditions. After this step, the simulations closely resemble the measurements, and the standard analysis pipeline used for measurements can also be applied to the simulations. In this presentation, we will describe the detector effects engine and the benchmarking tests performed with calibrations. We will also describe the application of these benchmarked simulations to create COSI's detector response.},

abstract = {The history of recent galactic nucleosynthesis activity can be studied by <br />measurements of the 1.809 MeV gamma-ray line arising from the decay of <br />radioactive 26Al.<br />The COMPTEL telescope aboard the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory, launched on <br />April 5, 1991, permits for the first time an extensive investigation of the <br />1.8 MeV radiation throughout the entire sky.<br />The aim of this thesis is to infer the galactic distribution of 26Al from <br />these measurements and to identify the dominant sources of this <br />radioactive isotope.<br /><br />The first part of the thesis is dedicated to the reconstruction of <br />the 1.8 MeV intensity distribution from the measured data.<br />It is demonstrated that the use of conventional deconvolution <br />algorithms, like maximum likelihood or maximum entropy inversion, <br />leads to lumpy, noise-dominated intensity distributions.<br />Nevertheless, simulations can help to assess the uncertainties in the <br />reconstructed images, which permits the scientific exploitation of the <br />recovered skymaps.<br />Alternatively, a multiresolution approach is proposed, which largely <br />reduces the uncertainties in the reconstructed 1.8 MeV intensity <br />distribution.<br />In summary, 1.8 MeV emission is mainly concentrated towards the <br />galactic plane, which clearly demonstrates that the bulk of 26Al is of <br />galactic rather than local origin.<br />However, distinct emission features towards Cygnus, Carina, and the <br />Auriga-Camelopardalis-Perseus region are inconsistent with a smooth <br />galactic 1.8 MeV emission profile, pointing towards a massive star <br />origin of 26Al.<br /><br />The second part of the thesis consists of a multi-wavelength <br />comparison of COMPTEL 1.8 MeV data which aims in the <br />identification of the origin of galactic 26Al.<br />For the comparison, a rigorous Bayesian analysis is applied, which <br />is the only consistent framework that allows inference based on the <br />comparison.<br />It turned out that the 1.8 MeV distribution follows very closely <br />the distribution of free electrons in the Galaxy which is traced by <br />thermal bremsstrahlung, observable in the microwave domain.<br />The similarity of the 1.8 MeV intensity distribution to the<br />thermal bremsstrahlung distribution implies a direct proportionality <br />between the 26Al and the massive star column densities, which strongly <br />supports that massive stars are the origin of galactic 26Al.<br />In particular, ONeMg-novae and AGB stars can be excluded as dominant <br />26Al sources since their galactic distribution is not expected to <br />correlate with the distribution of free electrons.<br /><br />The correlation between 26Al and free electrons established, the <br />analysis of 1.8 MeV gamma-ray line emission can complement our knowledge <br />about star formation and the distribution of ionized gas throughout <br />the entire Galaxy. <br />While COMPTEL made the first step in providing the first all-sky map <br />in the light of the 1.809 MeV line, INTEGRAL, the next generation gamma-ray spectrometer, will allow a detailed study of current star formation <br />in the Galaxy.},

abstract = {Half of the heavy elements including all actinides are produced in r-process nucleosynthesis, whose sites and history remain a mystery. If continuously produced, the Interstellar Medium is expected to build-up a quasi-steady state of abundances of short-lived nuclides (with half-lives $\le$100 My), including actinides produced in r-process nucleosynthesis. Their existence in today{\textquoteright}s interstellar medium would serve as a radioactive clock and would establish that their production was recent. In particular 244Pu, a radioactive actinide nuclide (half-life=81 My), can place strong constraints on recent r-process frequency and production yield. Here we report the detection of live interstellar 244Pu, archived in Earth{\textquoteright}s deep-sea floor during the last 25 My, at abundances lower than expected from continuous production in the Galaxy by about 2 orders of magnitude. This large discrepancy may signal a rarity of actinide r-process nucleosynthesis sites, compatible with neutron-star mergers or with a small subset of actinide-producing supernovae.},

The Solar Maximum Mission (SMM) spectrometer accumulated the quiescent atmospheric spectrum over its full 9-year lifetime and our analysis revealed 20 resolved line features. We compare this spectrum with one collected on October 20, 1989, when SMM observed gamma rays produced by shock-accelerated protons that impacted the atmosphere in the polar region following an intense solar flare and coronal mass ejection. Observed nuclear-line intensities increased by over a factor of 50 during this event. Because this event was on the horizon and subtended a limited solid angle as viewed from SMM, the local increase was several times higher. We compare the gamma ray line energies, widths, and intensities from the solar event and quiescent atmospheric spectra and discuss their identifications. From this comparison we confirm direct observations that the solar proton spectrum is considerably softer than the spectrum of cosmic rays. Extension of an existing code for calculating solar gamma ray lines will provide information on the spectra of the protons reaching the Earth's atmosphere and thus on their transport through the magnetosphere. Broad spectral features found in the spectra are likely to be caused by a multitude of unresolved lines excited by neutron capture in the instrument, spacecraft, and Earth's atmosphere.},

These processed LP-GRS time series data are used as the fundamental data set for deriving composition measurements of the lunar surface using either energy window techniques or the full modeling of the neutron and gamma-ray transport processes. The analyses that use these gamma-ray spectra to derive elemental abundances are beyond the scope of this manuscript but are described elsewhere in multiple publications. The processing described here to create the time series gamma-ray spectra includes selections to eliminate bad data as well as make corrections due to time variations in the cosmic ray flux, LP-GRS gain, LP-GRS orientation, and altitude above the lunar surface. Descriptions are also given of data uncertainties and how the LP-GRS data are mapped onto the lunar surface.},

abstract = {Context. The annihilation of cosmic positrons with electrons in the interstellar medium results in the strongest persistent $\gamma$-ray line signal in the sky. For the past 50 yr, this 511 keV emission - predominantly from the galactic bulge region and from a low surface-brightness disk - has puzzled observers and theoreticians. A key issue for understanding positron astrophysics is found in cosmic-ray propagation, especially at low kinetic energies (≲10 MeV). Aims: We want to shed light on how positrons propagate and the resulting morphology of the annihilation emission. We approach this "positron puzzle" by inferring kinematic information of the 511 keV line in the inner radian of the Galaxy. This constrains propagation scenarios and positron source populations in the Milky Way. Methods: By dissecting the positron annihilation emission as measured with INTEGRAL/SPI, we derived spectra for individual and independent regions in the sky. The centroid energies of these spectra around the 511 keV line are converted into Doppler shifts, representing the line-of-sight velocity along different galactic longitudes. This results in a longitude-velocity diagram of positron annihilation. From high-resolution spectra, we also determined Doppler-broadening from $\gamma$-ray line shape parameters to study annihilation conditions as they vary with galactic longitude. Results: We found line-of-sight velocities in the 511 keV line that are consistent with zero, as well as with galactic rotation from CO measurements (2-3 km s-1 deg-1), and measurements of radioactive 26Al (7.5-9.5 km s-1 deg-1). The velocity gradient in the inner {\textpm}30{\textdegree} is determined to be 4 {\textpm} 6 km s-1 deg-1. The width of the 511 keV line is constant as a function of longitude at 2.43 {\textpm} 0.14 keV, with possibly different values towards the disk. The positronium fraction is found to be 1.0 along the galactic plane. Conclusions: The weak signals in the disk leave the question open of whether positron annihilation is associated with the high velocities seen in 26Al or rather with ordinarily rotating components of the Milky Way's interstellar medium. We confirm previous results that positrons are slowed down to the 10 eV energy scale before annihilation and constrain bulk Doppler-broadening contributions to ≲1.25 keV in the inner radian. Consequently, the true annihilation conditions remain unclear.},

abstract = {Data obtained with the NICMOS instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have been used to determine the H-band luminosity function (LF) and mass function (MF) of three stellar fields in the globular cluster M 15, located {\~{ }}7' from the cluster centre. The data confirm that the cluster MF has a characteristic mass of {\~{ }}0.3 M⊙, as obtained by Paresce {\&} De Marchi (Paresce2000) for a stellar field at 4.6 arcmin from the centre. By combining the present data with those published by other authors for various radial distances (near the centre, at 20'' and at 4.6 arcmin), we have studied the radial variation of the LF due to the effects of mass segregation and derived the global mass function (GMF) using the Michie-King approach. The model that simultaneously best fits the LF at various locations, the surface brightness profile and the velocity dispersion profile suggest that the GMF should resemble a segmented power-law with the following indices: x ≃ 0.8 for stars more massive than 0.8 M⊙, x ≃ 0.9 for 0.3-0.8 M⊙ and x ≃ -2.2 at smaller masses (Salpeter's IMF would have x=1.35). The best fitting model also suggests that the cluster mass is {\~{ }}5.4 {\texttimes} 105 M⊙ and that the mass-to-light ratio is on average M/LV ≃ 2.1, with M/LV ≃ 3.7 in the core. A large amount of mass ({\~{ }}44%) is found in the cluster core in the form of stellar heavy remnants, which may be sufficient to explain the mass segregation in M 15 without invoking the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole.},

For star formation coordinated by the spiral arm pattern which, inside co-rotation, is overtaken by the faster moving stars and gas, outflows from spiral arm star clusters would preferentially flow into the cavities that are inflated by previous star formation associated with this arm.

The absorption component of the P-Cygni profiles then disappeared after the maximum, and reappeared when the novae brightened to the next maximum. We suggest that the re-appearance of the absorption component at the rebrightening can be attributable to a re-expansion of the photosphere after it once shifts sufficiently inside. From the light curves, we found that the time intervals of the rebrightenings of these 6 novae show a similar systematic trend, which is applicable to all types of novae; fast and slow, and Fe II type and hybrid type. Moreover, we note the difference between the spectra at the rebrightenings during the early phase and at the rebrightening in V2362 Cyg, and at the oscillation during the transition phase in V1494 Aql, which means a difference in the physical mechanism of the rebrightening during the early phase and the later oscillations.},

abstract = {We present constraints on decaying and annihilating dark matter (DM) in the 4 keV to 10 GeV mass range, using published results from the satellites HEAO-1, INTEGRAL, COMPTEL, EGRET, and the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope. We derive analytic expressions for the gamma-ray spectra from various DM decay modes, and find lifetime constraints in the range 1024 - 1028 sec, depending on the DM mass and decay mode. We map these constraints onto the parameter space for a variety of models, including a hidden photino that is part of a kinetically mixed hidden sector, a gravitino with R-parity violating decays, a sterile neutrino, DM with a dipole moment, and a dark pion. The indirect constraints on sterile-neutrino and hidden-photino DM are found to be more powerful than other experimental or astrophysical probes in some parts of parameter space. While our focus is on decaying DM, we also present constraints on DM annihilation to electron-positron pairs. We find that if the annihilation is p-wave suppressed, the galactic diffuse constraints are, depending on the DM mass and velocity at recombination, more powerful than the constraints from the Cosmic Microwave Background.},

The model is based on data from previous instruments and it considers both primary and secondary particles, charged particles, neutrons and photons. The necessary corrections to consider the geomagnetic cutoff are applied to calculate the flux at different inclinations and altitudes for a mean solar activity. Activation simulations from such a background have been carried out using the model of a possible future gamma-ray mission (e-ASTROGAM). The event rates and spectra from these simulations were then compared to those from the isotopes created by the particles present in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). The primary protons are found to be the main contributor of the activation, while the contributions of the neutrons, and that of the secondary protons can be considered negligible. The long-term activation from the passage through the SAA becomes the main source of background at high inclination (i≳ 10{\textdegree}). The used models have been collected in a Python class openly available on github.},

The 511 keV line flux for a typical Galactic center observation is (2.5 +/- 0.3) x 10 exp -4 gamma/sq cm per sec, where the quoted uncertainty represents the 1 sigma statistical uncertainty. No statistically significant time variability of the line flux has been observed; the 3 sigma upper limit to daily variations from the mean is 3 x 10 exp -4 gamma/sq cm per sec.

It consists of its previous version, PARMA3.0, for calculating the omnidirectional fluxes and several mathematical functions proposed in this study for expressing their zenith-angle dependences. The numerical values of the parameters used in these functions were fitted to reproduce the results of the extensive air shower simulation performed by Particle and Heavy Ion Transport code System (PHITS). The angular distributions of ground-level muons at large zenith angles were specially determined by introducing an optional function developed on the basis of experimental data. The accuracy of PARMA4.0 was closely verified using multiple sets of experimental data obtained under various global conditions. This extension enlarges the model{\textquoteright}s applicability to more areas of research, including design of cosmic-ray detectors, muon radiography, soil moisture monitoring, and cosmic-ray shielding calculation. PARMA4.0 is available freely and is easy to use, as implemented in the open-access EXcel-based Program for Calculating Atmospheric Cosmic-ray Spectrum (EXPACS).},

abstract = {We present an analysis of Voyager-1-IRIS and Cassini-CIRS spectra of Jupiter's high latitudes acquired during the spacecrafts' respective flybys in November 1979 and January 2001. We performed a forward-model analysis in order to derive the abundances of ethylene (C2H4), methylacetylene (CH3C2H), diacetylene (C4H2) and benzene (C6H6) in Jupiter's northern and southern auroral regions. We also compared these abundances to: 1) lower-latitude abundances predicted by the Moses et al. (2005) 'Model A' photochemical model, henceforth 'Moses 2005A', and 2) abundances derived at non-auroral longitudes in the same latitude band. This paper serves as an extension of Sinclair et al. (2017b), where we retrieved the vertical profiles of temperature, C2H2 and C2H6 from similar datasets. We find that an enrichment of C2H4, CH3C2H and C6H6 with respect to lower-latitude abundances is required to fit the spectra of Jupiter's northern and southern auroral regions. For example, for CIRS 0.5 cm-1 spectra of Jupiter's southern auroral region, scale factor enrichments of 6.40-1.15+1.30 and 9.60-3.67+3.98 are required with respect to the Moses 2005A vertical profiles of C2H4 and C6H6, respectively, in order to fit the spectral emission features of these species at ∼950 and ∼674 cm-1. Similarly, in order to fit the CIRS 2.5 cm-1 spectra of Jupiter's northern auroral region, scale factor enrichments of 1.60-0.21+0.37, 3.40-1.69+1.89 and 15.00-4.02+4.01 with respect to the Moses 2005A vertical profiles of C2H4, CH3C2H and C6H6 were required, respectively. Outside of Jupiter's auroral region in the same latitude bands, only upper-limit abundances of C2H4, CH3C2H and C6H6 could be determined due to the limited sensitivity of the measurements, the weaker emission features combined with cooler stratospheric temperatures (and therefore decreased thermal emission) of these regions. Nevertheless, for a subset of the observations, derived abundances of C2H4 and C6H6 in Jupiter's auroral regions were higher (by 1 $\sigma$) with respect to upper-limit abundances derived outside the auroral region in the same latitude band. This is suggestive that the influx of energetic ions and electrons from the Jovian magnetosphere and external solar-wind environment into the neutral atmosphere in Jupiter's auroral regions drives enhanced ion-related chemistry, as has also been inferred from Cassini observations of Saturn's high latitudes (Fletcher et al., 2018; Guerlet et al., 2015; Koskinen et al., 2016). We were not able to constrain the abundance of C4H2 in either Jupiter's auroral regions or non-auroral regions due to its lower (predicted) abundance and weaker emission feature. Thus, only upper-limit abundances were derived in both locations. From CIRS 2.5 cm-1 spectra, the upper limit abundance of C4H2 corresponds to a scale factor enhancement of 45.6 and 23.8 with respect to the Moses 2005A vertical profile in Jupiter's non-auroral and auroral regions.},

abstract = {Microquasars are stellar-mass black holes accreting matter from a companion star and ejecting plasma jets at almost the speed of light. They are analogues of quasars that contain supermassive black holes of 106 to 1010 solar masses. Accretion in microquasars varies on much shorter timescales than in quasars and occasionally produces exceptionally bright X-ray flares. How the flares are produced is unclear, as is the mechanism for launching the relativistic jets and their composition. An emission line near 511 kiloelectronvolts has long been sought in the emission spectrum of microquasars as evidence for the expected electron-positron plasma. Transient high-energy spectral features have been reported in two objects, but their positron interpretation remains contentious. Here we report observations of $\gamma$-ray emission from the microquasar V404 Cygni during a recent period of strong flaring activity. The emission spectrum around 511 kiloelectronvolts shows clear signatures of variable positron annihilation, which implies a high rate of positron production. This supports the earlier conjecture that microquasars may be the main sources of the electron-positron plasma responsible for the bright diffuse emission of annihilation $\gamma$-rays in the bulge region of our Galaxy. Additionally, microquasars could be the origin of the observed megaelectronvolt continuum excess in the inner Galaxy.},

Several theories have been proposed for this {\textquoteleft}Galactic centre excess{\textquoteright}. They include self-annihilation of dark-matter particles4, an unresolved population of millisecond pulsars5, an unresolved population of young pulsars6, or a series of burst events7. Here, we report on an analysis that exploits hydrodynamical modelling to register the position of interstellar gas associated with diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission. We find evidence that the Galactic centre excess gamma rays are statistically better described by the stellar over-density in the Galactic bulge and the nuclear stellar bulge, rather than a spherical excess. Given its non-spherical nature, we argue that the Galactic centre excess is not a dark-matter phenomenon but rather associated with the stellar population of the Galactic bulge and the nuclear bulge. New hydrodynamical models are used to fit the Fermi-LAT data of the Galactic centre and show that the excess $\gamma$-ray emission of the region is better fitted by a non-spherical shape, indicating that it is not caused by dark-matter-related phenomena.},

abstract = {Context. INTEGRAL observed Nova Sgr 2015 No. 2 (V5668 Sgr) around the time of its optical emission maximum on 21 March 2015. Studies at UV wavelengths showed spectral lines of freshly produced 7Be. This could also be measurable in gamma rays at 478 keV from the decay to 7Li. Novae are also expected to synthesise 22Na which decays to 22Ne, emitting a 1275 keV photon. About one week before the optical maximum, a strong gamma-ray flash on timescales of hours is expected from short-lived radioactive nuclei such as 13N and 18F. These nuclei are $\beta$+-unstable, and should yield emission of up to 511 keV, but this emission has never been observed from any nova. Aims: The SPectrometer on INTEGRAL (SPI) pointed towards V5668 Sgr by chance. We use these observations to search for possible gamma-ray emission of decaying 7Be, and to directly measure the synthesised mass during explosive burning. We also aim to constrain possible burst-like emission days to weeks before the optical maximum using the SPI anticoincidence shield (ACS), i.e. at times when SPI was not pointing to the source. Methods: We extracted spectral and temporal information to determine the fluxes of gamma-ray lines at 478 keV, 511 keV, and 1275 keV. Using distance and radioactive decay, a measured flux converts into the 7Be amount produced in the nova. The SPI-ACS rates are analysed for burst-like emission using a nova model light curve. For the obtained nova flash candidate events, we discuss possible origins using directional, spectral, and temporal information. Results: No significant excess for the 478 keV, the 511 keV, or the 1275 keV lines is found. Our upper limits (3$\sigma$) on the synthesised 7Be and 22Na mass depend on the uncertainties of the distance to V5668 Sgr: the 7Be mass is constrained to less than 4.8 {\texttimes} 10-9 (dkpc-1)2 M⊙, and the 22Na mass to less than 2.4 {\texttimes} 10-8 (dkpc-1)2 M⊙. For the 7Be mass estimate from UV studies, the distance to V5668 Sgr must be greater than 1.2 kpc (3$\sigma$). During the three weeks before the optical maximum, we find 23 burst-like events in the ACS rate, of which 6 could possibly be associated with V5668.},

abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size  and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter  on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient "turnkey" sampling algorithms.},

abstract = {Mergers of neutron stars (NS + NS) or neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes (NS + BH) eject a small fraction of matter with a subrelativistic velocity. Upon rapid decompression, nuclear-density medium condenses into neutron-rich nuclei, most of them radioactive. Radioactivity provides a long-term heat source for the expanding envelope. A brief transient has a peak luminosity in the supernova range, and the bulk of radiation in the UV-optical domain. We present a very crude model of the phenomenon, and simple analytical formulae that can be used to estimate the parameters of a transient as a function of poorly known input parameters. The mergers may be detected with high-redshift supernova searches as rapid transients, many of them far away from the parent galaxies. It is possible that the mysterious optical transients detected by Schmidt et al. are related to neutron star mergers, since they typically have no visible host galaxy.},

These new proper motions bring to 23 the number of MSPs with measured transverse velocities. In light of these new results we present and compare the kinematic properties of MSPs with those of ordinary pulsars. The mean transverse velocity of MSPs was found to be 85+/-13kms^-1, a value consistent with most models for the origin and evolution of MSPs and approximately a factor of 4 lower than that of ordinary pulsars. We also find that, in contrast to young ordinary pulsars, the vast majority of which are moving away from the Galactic plane, almost half of the MSPs are moving towards the plane. This near-isotropy would be expected of a population that has reached dynamic equilibrium. Accurate measurements of MSP velocities have allowed us to correct their measured spin-down rates for Doppler acceleration effects, and thereby derive their intrinsic magnetic field strengths and characteristic ages. We find that close to half of our sample of MSPs have a characteristic age comparable to or greater than the age of the Galactic disc.},

abstract = {We analyse IRAS and COBE DIRBE data at wavelengths between 2.2 and 240 mu m of the central 500 pc of the Galaxy and derive the large-scale distribution of stars and interstellar matter in the Nuclear Bulge. Models of the Galactic Disk and Bulge are developed in order to correctly decompose the total surface brightness maps of the inner Galaxy and to apply proper extinction corrections. The Nuclear Bulge appears as a distinct, massive disk-like complex of stars and molecular clouds which is, on a large scale, symmetric with respect to the Galactic Centre. It is distinguished from the Galactic Bulge by its flat disk-like morphology, very high density of stars and molecular gas, and ongoing star formation. The Nuclear Bulge consists of an R-2 Nuclear Stellar Cluster at the centre, a large Nuclear Stellar Disk with radius 230+/-20 pc and scale height 45+/- 5 pc, and the Nuclear Molecular Disk of same size. The total stellar mass and luminosity of the Nuclear Bulge are 1.4+/-0.6x 109 Msun and 2.5+/-1x 109 Lsun, respectively. About 70% of the luminosity is due to optical and UV radiation from young massive Main-Sequence stars which are most abundant in the Nuclear Stellar Cluster. For the first time, we derive a photometric mass distribution for the central 500 pc of the Galaxy which is fully consistent with the kinematic mass distribution. We find that the often cited R-2 distribution holds only for the central {\textasciitilde} 30 pc and that at larger radii the mass distribution is dominated by the Nuclear Stellar Disk which has a flatter density profile. The total interstellar hydrogen mass in the Nuclear Bulge is MH=2+/-0.3x 107 Msun, distributed in a warm inner disk with R=110+/-20 pc and a massive, cold outer torus which contains more than 80% of this mass. Interstellar matter in the Nuclear Bulge is very clumpy with {\textasciitilde} 90% of the mass contained in dense and massive molecular clouds with a volume filling factor of only a few per cent. This extreme clumpiness, probably caused by the tidal stability limit in the gravitational potential of the Nuclear Bulge, enables the strong interstellar radiation field to penetrate the entire Nuclear Bulge and explains the relatively low average extinction towards the Galactic Centre. In addition, we find 3x 107 Msun of cold and dense material outside the Nuclear Bulge at positive longitudes and 1x 107 Msun at negative longitudes. This material is not heated by the stars in the Nuclear Bulge and gives rise to the observed asymmetry in the distribution of interstellar matter in the Central Molecular Zone.},

abstract = {The possible gamma-ray excess in the inner Galaxy and the Galactic center (GC) suggested by Fermi-LAT observations has triggered a large number of studies. It has been interpreted as a variety of different phenomena such as a signal from WIMP dark matter annihilation, gamma-ray emission from a population of millisecond pulsars, or emission from cosmic rays injected in a sequence of burst-like events or continuously at the GC. We present the first comprehensive study of model systematics coming from the Galactic diffuse emission in the inner part of our Galaxy and their impact on the inferred properties of the excess emission at Galactic latitudes 2{\textdegree} < |b| < 20{\textdegree} and 300 MeV to 500 GeV. We study both theoretical and empirical model systematics, which we deduce from a large range of Galactic diffuse emission models and a principal component analysis of residuals in numerous test regions along the Galactic plane. We show that the hypothesis of an extended spherical excess emission with a uniform energy spectrum is compatible with the Fermi-LAT data in our region of interest at 95% CL. Assuming that this excess is the extended counterpart of the one seen in the inner few degrees of the Galaxy, we derive a lower limit of 10.0{\textdegree} (95% CL) on its extension away from the GC. We show that, in light of the large correlated uncertainties that affect the subtraction of the Galactic diffuse emission in the relevant regions, the energy spectrum of the excess is equally compatible with both a simple broken power-law of break energy Ebreak = 2.1 {\textpm} 0.2 GeV, and with spectra predicted by the self-annihilation of dark matter, implying in the case of bar bb final states a dark matter mass of m$\chi$=49+6.4-5.4 GeV.},

It is found that the radial dependences of intensities J can be approximated by a power of radial distance r as J $\propto$ r$\alpha$ with a different value of a constant in the inner and outer heliosphere with a transition at a radial distance of 10-15 AU. To study the physical meaning of these radial intensity profiles we examined the rigidity dependences of the intensity gradients by determining the particle mean free paths, using a simple one-dimensional modulation model. The particle mean free path $\lambda$ was assumed to be a separable function of distance of the form r$\gamma$ and rigidity R of R$\delta$ over the range of 0.5-3.0 GV in the inner and outer heliosphere. It was shown that $\lambda$ of rigidity dependence of R1.6 determined for Cycle 20/22 (qA > 0) with anomalous He is about 4-5 times larger than that of Cycle 21 (qA < 0) with R0.9 at around 1 GV in the outer heliosphere, and that the radial dependences are r1.4 and r1.1, respectively, for Cycles 20/22 and for Cycle 21.},

abstract = {<i>Context.<i/> Massive stars influence their environment through stellar winds, ionising radiation, and supernova explosions. This is signified by observed interstellar bubbles. Such feedback is an important factor for galaxy evolution theory and galactic wind models. The efficiency of the energy injection into the interstellar medium (ISM) via bubbles and superbubbles is uncertain, and is usually treated as a free parameter for galaxy scale effects. In particular, since many stars are born in groups, it is interesting to study the dependence of the effective energy injection on the concentration of the stars.<i>Aims.<i/> We aim to reproduce observations of superbubbles, their relation to the energy injection of the parent stars, and to understand their effective energy input into the ISM, as a function of the spatial configuration of the group of parent stars. <i>Methods.<i/> We study the evolution of isolated and merging interstellar bubbles of three stars (25, 32, and 60{\textasciitilde}<i>M<i/><sub>⊙<sub/>) in a homogeneous background medium with a density of 10<i>m<i/><sub>p<sub/>{\textasciitilde}cm<sup>-3<sup/> via 3D-hydrodynamic simulations with standard ISM thermodynamics (optically thin radiative cooling and photo-electric heating) and time-dependent energy and mass input according to stellar evolutionary tracks. We vary the position of the three stars relative to each other to compare the energy response for cases of isolated, merging and initially cospatial bubbles.<i>Results.<i/> Mainly due to the Vishniac instability, our simulated bubbles develop thick shells and filamentary internal structures in column density. The shell widths reach tens of per cent of the outer bubble radius, which compares favourably to observations. More energy is retained in the ISM for more closely packed groups, by up to a factor of three and typically a factor of two for intermediate times after the first supernova. Once the superbubble is established, different positions of the contained stars make only a minor difference to the energy tracks. For our case of three massive stars, the energy deposition varies only very little for distances up to about 30{\textasciitilde}pc between the stars. Energy injected by supernovae is entirely dissipated in a superbubble on a timescale of about 1{\textasciitilde}Myr, which increases slightly with the superbubble size at the time of the explosion.<i>Conclusions.<i/> The Vishniac instability may be responsible for the broadening of the shells of interstellar bubbles. Massive star winds are significant energetically due to their {\textendash} in the long run {\textendash} more efficient, steady energy injection and because they evacuate the space around the massive stars. For larger scale simulations, the feedback effect of close groups of stars or clusters may be subsumed into one effective energy input with insignificant loss of energy accuracy.},

Designed on the basis of the intuition that sarcastic tweets are likely to have a mixture of words of both sentiments as against tweets with literal sentiment (either positive or negative), our hierarchical topic model discovers sarcasm-prevalent topics and topic-level sentiment. Using a dataset of tweets labeled using hashtags, the model estimates topic-level, and sentiment-level distributions. Our evaluation shows that topics such as `work', `gun laws', `weather' are sarcasm-prevalent topics. Our model is also able to discover the mixture of sentiment-bearing words that exist in a text of a given sentiment-related label. Finally, we apply our model to predict sarcasm in tweets. We outperform two prior work based on statistical classifiers with specific features, by around 25%.},

From a comparison of our results with Monte Carlo simulations, we find that the mean birth speed of a pulsar is about 250-300 km/s, rather than the 450 km/s found by Lyne and Lorimer (1994). The resultant distribution is consistent with a Maxwellian with dispersion sigma(v) = 190 km/s. Despite the large birth velocities, we find that the pulsars with long characteristic ages show the asymmetric drift, indicating that they are dynamically old. These pulsars may result from the low-velocity tail of the younger population, although modified by their origin in binaries and by evolution in the galactic potential.},

abstract = {Deposition of a massive (104-105 M⊙) giant molecular cloud (GMC) into the inner parsec of the Galaxy is widely believed to explain the origin of over a hundred unusually massive young stars born there ∼6 Myr ago. An unknown fraction of that gas could have been accreted by Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole of the Milky Way. It has been recently suggested that two observed $\gamma$-ray-emitting bubbles emanating from the very centre of our Galaxy were inflated by this putative activity of Sgr A*. We run a suite of numerical simulations to test whether the observed morphology of the bubbles could be due to the collimation of a wide-angle outflow from Sgr A* by the disc-like Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), a well-known massive repository of molecular gas in the central ∼200 pc. We find that an Eddington-limited outburst of Sgr A* lasting ≃1 Myr is required to reproduce the morphology of the Fermi bubbles, suggesting that the GMC mass was ∼105 M⊙ and it was mainly accreted by Sgr A* rather than used to make stars. We also find that the outflow from Sgr A* enforces strong angular momentum mixing in the CMZ disc, robustly sculpting it into a much narrower structure - a ring - perhaps synonymous with the recently reported 'Herschel ring'. In addition, we find that Sgr A* outflow is likely to have induced formation of massive star-forming GMCs in the CMZ. In this scenario, the Arches and Quintuplet clusters, the two observed young star clusters in the central tens of parsecs of the Galaxy, and also GMCs such as Sgr B2, owe their existence to the recent Sgr A* activity.},

Our analysis is based on data from the performance verification phase of the INTEGRAL instruments and comprises 1.3 Ms of exposure time. We observe a 1809 keV line flux of (7.3 +/- 0.9) x 10-5 ph cm-2 s-1 from a region delimited by galactic longitudes 73-93 deg and |b| < 7 deg at a significance level of 8 sigma. The 1809 keV line appears moderately broadened, with an intrinsic FWHM of 3.3 +/- 1.3 keV. Although this broadening is only marginal (at the 2 sigma level our data are compatible with an unbroadened line), it could reflect the 26Al ejecta kinematics.},

abstract = {The binary neutron star merger GW170817 detected by Advanced LIGO/Virgo was followed by a short gamma-ray burst (GRB) and thermal radiation ('kilonova') powered by the radioactive decay of heavy nuclei synthesized in the merger ejecta by the rapid neutron capture process ('r-process'). The large inferred quantity of ejecta is best understood as originating in an outflow from the accretion disk surrounding the newly-formed black hole, the same engine that was likely responsible for the GRB jet. Similar accretion flows accompany the collapse of rotating massive stars ('collapsars'), powering the class of long GRBs and their associated supernovae. Here we show that collapsar accretion disks also produce neutron-rich outflows that synthesize heavy r-process nuclei, despite the comparatively proton-rich composition of the infalling star. Though occurring less frequently than mergers, the much greater accreted mass in collapsars---and their correspondingly larger disk wind ejecta---implicate them as dominant contributors to the Galactic r-process. Collapsars provide the rare r-process source needed to promptly enrich a small fraction of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies early in the Universe which is also compatible with the Galactic chemical enrichment of europium relative to iron over longer timescales. We predict an excess in the late-time near-infrared emission from GRB supernovae, testable by future observations.},

abstract = {Helioseismological sound-speed profiles severely constrain possible deviations from standard solar models, allowing us to derive new limits on anomalous solar energy losses by the Primakoff emission of axions. For an axion-photon coupling gay ≲ 5 {\texttimes} 10 -10 GeV -1, the solar model is almost indistinguishable from the standard case, while gay ≳ 10 {\texttimes} 10 -10 GeV -1 is probably excluded, corresponding to an axion luminosity of about 0.20 L⊙. This constraint on gay is much weaker than the well-known globular-cluster limit, but about a factor of 3 more restrictive than previous solar limits. Our result is primarily of interest to the large number of current or proposed search experiments for solar axions because our limit defines the maximum gay for which it is self-consistent to use a standard solar model to calculate the axion luminosity.},

COSI is a Compton telescope that covers the bandpass often referred to as the "MeV Gap" because it is the least explored region of the whole electromagnetic spectrum. COSI provides a significant improvement in sensitivity along with high-resolution spectroscopy, enabling studies of 511 keV electron-positron annihilation emission and measurements of several radioactive elements that trace the Galactic history of supernovae. COSI also measures polarization of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), accreting black holes, and pulsars as well as detecting and localizing multimessenger sources. In the following, we describe the COSI science, the instrument, and its capabilities. We highlight many Astro2020 science WPs that describe the COSI science in depth.},

abstract = {With the advent of sophisticated X-ray observatories, viz., Chandra and XMM-Newton, the field of planetary X-ray astronomy is advancing at a faster pace. Several new solar system objects are now know to shine in X-rays at energies generally below 2 keV. Jupiter, Saturn, and Earth, all three magnetized planets, have been observed by Chandra and XMM-Newton. At Jupiter, both auroral and non-auroral disk X-ray emissions have been observed. The first soft X-ray observation of Earth's aurora by Chandra shows that it is highly variable. X-rays have been detected from Saturn's disk, but no convincing evidence of X-ray aurora has been seen. Several comets have been observed in X-rays by Chandra and XMM-Newton. Cometary X-rays are produced due to change exchange of solar wind ions with cold cometary neutrals. Soft X-rays have also been observed from Venus, Mars, Moon, Io, Europa, Io plasma torus, and heliosphere. The non-auroral X-ray emissions from Jupiter, Saturn, and Earth, and those from sunlit disk of Mars, Venus, and Moon are produced due to scattering of solar X-rays. The spectral characteristics of X-ray emission from comets, heliosphere, darkside of Moon, and Martian halo are quite similar, but they appear to be quite different from those of Jovian auroral X-rays. The X-ray aurora on Earth is generated by electron bremsstrahlung and on Jupiter by precipitation of highly-ionized energetic heavy ions. In this paper we will present a comparative overview of X-ray emission from different solar system objects and make an attempt to synthesize a coherent picture.},

abstract = {e-ASTROGAM ('enhanced ASTROGAM') is a breakthrough Observatory space mission, with a detector composed by a Silicon tracker, a calorimeter, and an anticoincidence system, dedicated to the study of the non-thermal Universe in the photon energy range from 0.3 MeV to 3 GeV - the lower energy limit can be pushed to energies as low as 150 keV for the tracker, and to 30 keV for calorimetric detection. The mission is based on an advanced space-proven detector technology, with unprecedented sensitivity, angular and energy resolution, combined with polarimetric capability. Thanks to its performance in the MeV-GeV domain, substantially improving its predecessors, e-ASTROGAM will open a new window on the non-thermal Universe, making pioneering observations of the most powerful Galactic and extragalactic sources, elucidating the nature of their relativistic outflows and their effects on the surroundings. With a line sensitivity in the MeV energy range one to two orders of magnitude better than previous generation instruments, e-ASTROGAM will determine the origin of key isotopes fundamental for the understanding of supernova explosion and the chemical evolution of our Galaxy. The mission will provide unique data of significant interest to a broad astronomical community, complementary to powerful observatories such as LIGO-Virgo-GEO600-KAGRA, SKA, ALMA, E-ELT, TMT, LSST, JWST, Athena, CTA, IceCube, KM3NeT, and LISA.},

abstract = {The distribution of elements produced in the innermost layers of a supernova explosion is a key diagnostic for studying the collapse of massive stars. Here we present the results of a 2.4 Ms NuSTAR observing campaign aimed at studying the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A). We perform spatially resolved spectroscopic analyses of the 44Ti ejecta, which we use to determine the Doppler shift and thus the three-dimensional (3D) velocities of the 44Ti ejecta. We find an initial 44Ti mass of (1.54 {\textpm} 0.21) {\texttimes} 10-4 M⊙, which has a present-day average momentum direction of 340{\textdegree} {\textpm} 15{\textdegree} projected onto the plane of the sky (measured clockwise from celestial north) and is tilted by 58{\textdegree} {\textpm} 20{\textdegree} into the plane of the sky away from the observer, roughly opposite to the inferred direction of motion of the central compact object. We find some 44Ti ejecta that are clearly interior to the reverse shock and some that are clearly exterior to it. Where we observe 44Ti ejecta exterior to the reverse shock we also see shock-heated iron; however, there are regions where we see iron but do not observe 44Ti. This suggests that the local conditions of the supernova shock during explosive nucleosynthesis varied enough to suppress the production of 44Ti by at least a factor of two in some regions, even in regions that are assumed to be the result of processes like $\alpha$-rich freezeout that should produce both iron and titanium.},

abstract = {Asymmetry is required by most numerical simulations of stellar core-collapse explosions, but the form it takes differs significantly among models. The spatial distribution of radioactive 44Ti, synthesized in an exploding star near the boundary between material falling back onto the collapsing core and that ejected into the surrounding medium, directly probes the explosion asymmetries. CassiopeiaA is a young, nearby, core-collapse remnant from which 44Ti emission has previously been detected but not imaged. Asymmetries in the explosion have been indirectly inferred from a high ratio of observed 44Ti emission to estimated 56Ni emission, from optical light echoes, and from jet-like features seen in the X-ray and optical ejecta. Here we report spatial maps and spectral properties of the 44Ti in Cassiopeia A. This may explain the unexpected lack of correlation between the 44Ti and iron X-ray emission, the latter being visible only in shock-heated material. The observed spatial distribution rules out symmetric explosions even with a high level of convective mixing, as well as highly asymmetric bipolar explosions resulting from a fast-rotating progenitor. Instead, these observations provide strong evidence for the development of low-mode convective instabilities in core-collapse supernovae.},

abstract = {The amplitude of the magnetic field near the Galactic Centre has been uncertain by two orders of magnitude for several decades. On a scale of {\textasciitilde}100 parsecs (pc), fields of {\textasciitilde}1,000 microgauss ($\mu$G refs 1-3) have been reported, implying a magnetic energy density more than 10,000 times stronger than typical for the Galaxy. Alternatively, the assumption of pressure equilibrium between the various phases of the Galactic Centre interstellar medium (including turbulent molecular gas, the contested {\textquoteleft}very hot{\textquoteright} plasma, and the magnetic field) suggests fields of {\textasciitilde}100 $\mu$G over {\textasciitilde}400 pc size scales. Finally, assuming equipartition, fields of only {\textasciitilde}6 $\mu$G have been inferred from radio observations for 400 pc scales. Here we report a compilation of previous data that reveals a downward break in the region's non-thermal radio spectrum (attributable to a transition from bremsstrahlung to synchrotron cooling of the in situ cosmic-ray electron population). We show that the spectral break requires that the Galactic Centre field be at least {\textasciitilde}50 $\mu$G on 400 pc scales, lest the synchrotron-emitting electrons produce too much $\gamma$-ray emission, given other existing constraints. Other considerations support a field of 100 $\mu$G, implying that over 10% of the Galaxy's magnetic energy is contained in only <{\textasciitilde}0.05% of its volume.},

abstract = {On 1991 January 20-21, the SIGMA telescope on board GRANAT detected a relatively narrow variable emission line near 500 keV with net flux of about 0.006 photons/s/sq cm in the spectrum of the X-ray Nova Muscae. During 1991 January 9-August 14, the spectrum had a strong hard component extending up to about 300 keV with average power-law photon index about 2.5. This component varies by a factor about 2 on time scales of hours. The hard component was absent only once, on April 12, but it reappeared during subsequent observations on May 31 and August 14. In contrast to the soft component, the light curve of the hard X-ray component does not decay exponentially, and so its relative contribution to the luminosity increased with time.},

abstract = {A survey of the entire southern sky for millisecond and low-luminosity pulsars using the ATNF Parkes radio telescope has now been completed. The survey detected 298 pulsars, of which 101 were previously unknown. The new pulsars include 17 millisecond pulsars. This is the largest sample of both normal and millisecond pulsars detected in any survey. Combining our sample with other recent surveys in the Northern Hemisphere, we present a statistical study of the populations of both normal and millisecond pulsars. We find that the improved statistics allow us to estimate the number and birth-rate of both types of pulsar down to a 400-MHz luminosity limit of 1 mJy kpc^2. The local surface densities of potentially observable normal pulsars and millisecond pulsars are both about 30 kpc^-2, corresponding to {\textasciitilde}30000 potentially observable pulsars of each type in the Galaxy. Once beaming effects are taken into consideration we estimate that the active population of normal pulsars is {\textasciitilde}160000. Although there is evidence for flattening of the luminosity function of normal pulsars, this is not evident for millisecond pulsars which probably have a substantial population with luminosities below 1 mJy kpc^2. After correcting for beaming effects, we estimate that a normal pulsar is born with a luminosity greater than 1 mJy kpc^2 between once every 60 and 330 yr in the Galaxy. The birth-rate of millisecond pulsars is at least 3x10^-6 yr^-1 above the same luminosity limit. Modelling the observed transverse speeds of millisecond pulsars using a dynamical simulation, we find their mean birth velocity to be 130+/-30 km s^-1, significantly lower than that of the normal pulsars.},

abstract = {We reexamine in detail the various processes undergone by positrons in the interstellar medium (ISM) from their birth to their annihilation using the most recent results of positron interaction cross sections with atomic and molecular hydrogen, as well as helium. The positrons' lives are divided into two phases: the {\textquotedblleft}in-flight{\textquotedblright} phase (between $\approx$1 MeV and tens of eV) and the thermal phase. The first phase is treated with a Monte Carlo simulation that allows us to determine the fraction of positrons that form positronium and annihilate as well as the characteristics of the annihilation emission as a function of the medium conditions. The second phase is treated with a binary reaction rate approach, with cross sections adopted from experimental measurement or theoretical calculations. An extensive search and update of the knowledge of positron processes was thus undertaken. New reaction rates and line widths have been obtained. We investigate the treatment of the complicated interactions between positrons and interstellar dust grains. Fully relevant data were not always available, but we were nonetheless able to reach satisfactory understanding of positron annihilation on grains, both qualitatively and quantitatively. All factors of the problem have been considered, including the grain size distribution and composition, the electric charge of the grains, the backscattering, positronium formation and ejection from the grain, the pick-off annihilation inside them and the partial destruction of dust in the hot regions of the ISM. New reaction rates and widths of the line resulting from the annihilation inside and outside of the grain have been obtained. The final results of our calculations (reaction rates and spectra) showed that dust is only important in the hot phase of the ISM, where it dominates all other processes. Combining the new calculations, we have constructed annihilation spectra for each phase of the ISM, considering various grain contents, as well as an overall combined spectrum for the ISM as a whole.},

The imaging capabilities of the instrument are obtained with a tungsten coded aperture mask located 1.7 m from the Ge array. The fully coded field-of-view is 16ensuremath o, the partially coded field of view amounts to 31ensuremath o, and the angular resolution is 2.5ensuremath o. The energy range extends from 20 keV to 8 MeV with a typical energy resolution of 2.5 keV at 1.3 MeV. Here we present the general concept of the instrument followed by a brief description of each of the main subsystems.

abstract = {Over the past few decades, an anomalous 511 keV gamma-ray line has been observed from the center of the Milky Way. Dark matter (DM) in the form of light (≲10 MeV ) weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) annihilating into electron-positron pairs has been one of the leading hypotheses of the observed emission. Given the small required cross section, {\textlangle}$\sigma$ v {\textrangle}∼1 0-30 cm3 s-1 , a further coupling to lighter particles is required to produce the correct relic density. Here, we derive constraints from the Planck satellite on light WIMPs that were in equilibrium with either the neutrino or electron sector in the early universe. For the neutrino sector, we obtain a lower bound on the WIMP mass of 4 MeV for a real scalar and 10 MeV for a Dirac fermion DM particle, at 95% C.L. For the electron sector, we find even stronger bounds of 7 and 11 MeV, respectively. Using these results, we show that, in the absence of additional ingredients such as dark radiation, the light thermally produced WIMP explanation of the 511 keV excess is strongly disfavored by the latest cosmological data. This suggests an unknown astrophysical or more exotic DM source of the signal.},

abstract = {The positron emissivity of the Galactic bulge and disk, resulting from radioactivity of SNIa, is reassessed in the light of a recent evaluation of the SNIa rate. It is found that the disk may supply more positrons than required by recent observations, but the bulge (where the characteristic{\textasciitilde}e<sup>+<sup/>{\textasciitilde}annihilation line at{\textasciitilde}511{\textasciitilde}keV is in fact observed by SPI/INTEGRAL) only about 10% of the total. It is argued that a large fraction of the disk positrons may be transported via the regular magnetic field of the Galaxy into the bulge, where they annihilate. This would increase both the bulge positron emissivity and the bulge/disk ratio, alleviating considerably the constraints imposed by INTEGRAL data analysis. We argue that the bulge/disk ratio can be considerably smaller than the values derived by the recent analysis of Kn{\"o}dlseder et{\textasciitilde}al. (2005, A{\&}A, 441, 513), if the disk positrons diffuse sufficiently away from their sources, as required by our model; this possibility could be soon tested, as data are accumulated in the SPI{\textasciitilde}detectors. The success of the proposed scenario depends critically upon the, very poorly known at present, properties of the galactic magnetic field and of the propagation of low energy positrons in it.},

abstract = {The inner Milky Way is dominated by a boxy, triaxial bulge which is believed to have formed through disc instability processes. Despite its proximity, its large-scale properties are still not very well known, due to our position in the obscuring Galactic disc. Here, we make a measurement of the three-dimensional density distribution of the Galactic bulge using red clump giants identified in DR1 of the Vista Variables in the Via Lactea survey. Our density map covers the inner (2.2 {\texttimes} 1.4 {\texttimes} 1.1) kpc of the bulge/bar. Line-of-sight density distributions are estimated by deconvolving extinction- and completeness-corrected Ks-band magnitude distributions. In constructing our measurement, we assume that the three-dimensional bulge is eightfold mirror triaxially symmetric. In doing so, we measure the angle of the bar-bulge to the line of sight to be (27 {\textpm} 2){\textdegree}, where the dominant error is systematic arising from the details of the deconvolution process. The resulting density distribution shows a highly elongated bar with projected axis ratios $\approx$(1 : 2.1) for isophotes reaching ∼2 kpc along the major axis. Along the bar axes the density falls off roughly exponentially, with axis ratios (10 : 6.3 : 2.6) and exponential scalelengths (0.70 : 0.44 : 0.18) kpc. From about 400 pc above the Galactic plane, the bulge density distribution displays a prominent X-structure. Overall, the density distribution of the Galactic bulge is characteristic for a strongly boxy/peanut-shaped bulge within a barred galaxy.},

For spectral fitting the data are split into early and late periods covering days 19-35 and 50-162, respectively, optimized for 56Ni and 56Co lines. As expected for the early period, much of the gamma-ray signal is confined to energies below ∼200 keV, while for the late period it is strongest above 400 keV. In particular, in the late period, 56Co lines at 847 and 1248 keV are detected at 4.7$\sigma$ and 4.3$\sigma$, respectively. The light curves in several representative energy bands are calculated for the entire period. The resulting spectra and light curves are compared with a subset of models. We confirm our previous finding that the gamma-ray data are broadly consistent with the expectations for canonical one-dimensional models, such as delayed detonation or deflagration models for a near-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf. Late optical spectra (day 136 after the explosion) show rather symmetric Co and Fe line profiles, suggesting that, unless the viewing angle is special, the distribution of radioactive elements is symmetric in the ejecta.},

abstract = {During the first observing run of LIGO, two gravitational wave events and one lower-significance trigger (LVT151012) were reported by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration. At the time of LVT151012, the INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) was pointing at a region of the sky coincident with the high localization probability area of the event and thus permitted us to search for its electromagnetic counterpart (both prompt and afterglow emission). The imaging instruments on board INTEGRAL (IBIS/ISGRI, IBIS/PICsIT, SPI, and the two JEM-X modules) have been exploited to attempt the detection of any electromagnetic emission associated with LVT151012 over three decades in energy (from 3 keV to 8 MeV). The omni-directional instruments on board the satellite, I.e., the SPI-ACS and the IBIS/Veto, complemented the capabilities of the IBIS/ISGRI and IBIS/PICsIT for detections outside their imaging field of view in order to provide an efficient monitoring of the entire LVT151012 localization region at energies above 75 keV. We did not find any significant transient source that was spatially and/or temporally coincident with LVT151012, obtaining tight upper limits on the associated hard X-ray and $\gamma$-ray radiation. For typical spectral models, the upper limits on the fluence of the emission from any 1 s counterpart of LVT151012 ranges from F$\gamma$ = 3.5 {\texttimes} 10-8 erg cm-2 (20-200 keV), within the field of view of the imaging instruments, to F$\gamma$ = 7.1 {\texttimes} 10-7 erg cm-2 (75-2000 keV), considering the least favorable location of the counterpart for a detection by the omni-directional instruments. These results can be interpreted as a tight constraint on the ratio of the isotropic equivalent energy released in the electromagnetic emission to the total energy of the gravitational waves: E75-2000 keV/EGW< 4.4 {\texttimes} 10-5. Finally, we provide an exhaustive summary of the capabilities of all instruments on board INTEGRAL to hunt for $\gamma$-ray counterparts of gravitational wave events, exploiting both serendipitousand pointed follow-up observations. This will serve as a reference for all future searches.},

abstract = {We construct a simple model of the star-formation- (and resultant supernova-) driven mass and energy flows through the inner ∼200 pc (in diameter) of the Galaxy. Our modelling is constrained, in particular, by the non-thermal radio continuum and $\gamma$-ray signals detected from the region. The modelling points to a current star formation rate of 0.04-0.12 M⊙ yr-1 at 2$\sigma$ confidence within the region with best-fitting value in the range 0.08-0.12 M⊙ yr-1 which - if sustained over 10 Gyr - would fill out the ∼109 M⊙ stellar population of the nuclear bulge. Mass is being accreted on to the Galactic Centre (GC) region at a rate ? yr-1. The region's star formation activity drives an outflow of plasma, cosmic rays and entrained, cooler gas. Neither the plasma nor the entrained gas reaches the gravitational escape speed, however, and all this material fountains back on to the inner Galaxy. The system we model can naturally account for the recently observed ≳106 M⊙'halo' of molecular gas surrounding the Central Molecular Zone out to 100-200 pc heights. The injection of cooler, high-metallicity material into the Galactic halo above the GC may catalyze the subsequent cooling and condensation of hot plasma out of this region and explain the presence of relatively pristine, nuclear-unprocessed gas in the GC. This process may also be an important ingredient in understanding the long-term stability of the GC star formation rate. The plasma outflow from the GC reaches a height of a few kpc and is compellingly related to the recently discovered Fermi bubbles by a number of pieces of evidence. These include that the outflow advects precisely (i) the power in cosmic rays required to sustain the bubbles'$\gamma$-ray luminosity in saturation; (ii) the hot gas required to compensate for gas cooling and drop-out from the bubbles and (iii) the magnetic field required to stabilize the walls of these structures. Our modelling demonstrates that ∼109 M⊙ of hot gas is processed through the GC over 10 Gyr. We speculate that the continual star formation in the GC over the age of the Milky Way has kept the supermassive black hole in a quiescent state thus preventing it from significantly heating the coronal gas, allowing for the continual accretion of gas on to the disc and the sustenance of star formation on much wider scales in the Galaxy. In general, our investigations explicitly reveal the GC's important role in the Milky Way's wider stellar ecology.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts are the most energetic electromagnetic sources in the Universe. Their prompt gamma-ray radiation corresponds to an energy release of 1E42-1E47J. Fifty years after their discovery and several dedicated space-based instruments, the physical origin of this emission is still unknown. Synchrotron emission has been one of the early contenders but was criticized because spectral fits of empirical models (such as a smoothly-connected broken power law or a cut-off power law) suggest too hard a slope of the low-energy power law, violating the so-called synchrotron line-of-death. We perform time-resolved gamma-ray spectroscopy of single-peaked GRBs as measured with Fermi/GBM. We demonstrate that idealized synchrotron emission, when properly incorporating time-dependent cooling of the electrons, is capable of fitting {\textasciitilde}95% of all these GBM spectra. The comparison with spectral fit results based on previous empirical models demonstrates that the past exclusion of synchrotron radiation as an emission mechanism derived via the line-of-death was misleading. Our analysis probes the physics of these ultra-relativistic outflows and the related microphysical processes, and for the first time provides estimates of magnetic field strength and Lorentz factors of the emitting region directly from spectral fits. Our modeling of the Fermi/GBM observations provides evidence that GRBs are produced by moderately magnetized jets in which relativistic mini-jets emit optically-thin synchrotron radiation at large emission radii.},

The VISTA Variables in the V{\'\i}a L{\'a}ctea survey (VVV) is a near-IR ESO Public Survey mapping the Milky Way bulge and southern plane. Data taken during 2010{\textendash}2011 covered the entire area in the <i>JH<i/><i>K<i/><sub>s<sub/> bands plus some epochs in <i>K<i/><sub>s<sub/>-band of the ongoing VVV variability campaign.<i>Aims. <i/>We used the VVV data to create a near-IR catalogue of the known Galactic novae in the 562 sq. deg. area covered by VVV. We also compiled the information about novae from the variability tables of the VVV variability campaign.<i>Methods. <i/>We used the novae list provided by VSX/AAVSO catalogue to search for all objects within the VVV area.

Since objects are seen at different distances and reddening levels, the colour{\textendash}magnitude and colour{\textendash}colour diagrams show the novae spread in magnitude as well as in colour. Dereddened colours and reddening-free indices were used with caution and cannot be a good approach in all cases since the distance and spectral features prevent more conclusive results for some extreme objects. Light curves for some recent novae are presented.<i>Conclusions. <i/>Thanks to its high spatial resolution in the near IR and wide <i>K<i/><sub>s<sub/>-range, the VVV survey can be a major contributor to the search for and study of novae in the most crowded and high-extinction regions of the Milky Way.

abstract = {Context. A promising source of the positrons that contribute through annihilation to the diffuse Galactic 511 keV emission is the $\beta$+-decay of unstable nuclei like 56Ni and 44Ti synthesised by massive stars and supernovae. Although a large fraction of these positrons annihilate in the ejecta of SNe/SNRs, no point-source of annihilation radiation appears in the INTEGRAL/SPI map of the 511 keV emission. Aims: We exploit the absence of detectable annihilation emission from young local SNe/SNRs to derive constraints on the transport of MeV positrons inside SN/SNR ejecta and their escape into the CSM/ISM, both aspects being crucial to the understanding of the observed Galactic 511 keV emission. Methods: We simulated 511 keV lightcurves resulting from the annihilation of the decay positrons of 56Ni and 44Ti in SNe/SNRs and their surroundings using a simple model. We computed specific 511 keV lightcurves for Cas A, Tycho, Kepler, SN1006, G1.9+0.3 and SN1987A, and compared these to the upper-limits derived from INTEGRAL/SPI observations. Results: The predicted 511 keV signals from positrons annihilating in the ejecta are below the sensitivity of the SPI instrument by several orders of magnitude, but the predicted 511 keV signals for positrons escaping the ejecta and annihilating in the surrounding medium allowed to derive upper-limits on the positron escape fraction of {\textasciitilde}13% for Cas A, {\textasciitilde}12% for Tycho, {\textasciitilde}30% for Kepler and {\textasciitilde}33% for SN1006. Conclusions: The transport of {\textasciitilde}MeV positrons inside SNe/SNRs cannot be constrained from current observations of the 511 keV emission from these objects, but the limits obtained on their escape fraction are consistent with a nucleosynthesis origin of the positrons that give rise to the diffuse Galactic 511 keV emission.},

abstract = {Employing Fermi-LAT gamma-ray observations, several independent groups have found excess extended gamma-ray emission at the Galactic Center (GC). Both annihilating dark matter (DM) or a population of ∼103 unresolved millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are regarded as well-motivated possible explanations. However, there are significant uncertainties in the diffuse galactic background at the GC. We have performed a revaluation of these two models for the extended gamma-ray source at the GC by accounting for the systematic uncertainties of the Galactic diffuse emission model. We also marginalize over point-source and diffuse background parameters in the region of interest. We show that the excess emission is significantly more extended than a point source. We find that the DM (or pulsar-population) signal is larger than the systematic errors and therefore proceed to determine the sectors of parameter space that provide an acceptable fit to the data. We find that a population of 1000-2000 MSPs with parameters consistent with the average spectral shape of Fermi-LAT measured MSPs is able to fit the GC excess emission. For DM, we find that a pure $\tau$+$\tau$- annihilation channel is not a good fit to the data. But a mixture of $\tau$+$\tau$- and bb{\textasciimacron} with a {\textlangle}$\sigma$v{\textrangle} of order the thermal relic value and a DM mass of around 20 to 60 GeV provides an adequate fit.},

abstract = {Aims: We derive the spectra of the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) and of the Galactic ridge X-ray emission (GRXE) in the {\textasciitilde}20-200 keV range from the data of the IBIS instrument aboard the INTEGRAL satellite obtained during the four dedicated Earth-occultation observations in early 2006. Methods: We analyze the modulation of the IBIS/ISGRI detector counts induced by the passage of the Earth through the field of view of the instrument. Unlike previous studies, we do not fix the spectral shape of the various contributions, but model instead their spatial distribution and derive for each of them the expected modulation of the detector counts. The spectra of the diffuse emission components are obtained by fitting the normalizations of the model lightcurves to the observed modulation in different energy bins. Because of degeneracy, we guide the fits with a realistic choice of the input parameters and a constraint for spectral smoothness. Results: The obtained CXB spectrum is consistent with the historic HEAO-1 results and falls slightly below the spectrum derived with Swift/BAT. A 10% higher normalization of the CXB cannot be completely excluded, but it would imply an unrealistically high albedo of the Earth. The derived spectrum of the GRXE confirms the presence of a minimum around 80 keV with improved statistics and yields an estimate of {\textasciitilde}0.6 M⊙ for the average mass of white dwarfs in the Galaxy. The analysis also provides updated normalizations for the spectra of the Earth's albedo and the cosmic-ray induced atmospheric emission. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of INTEGRAL Earth-occultation observations to derive the hard X-ray spectra of three fundamental components: the CXB, the GRXE and the Earth emission. Further observations would be extremely valuable to confirm our results with improved statistics.},

As a Compton telescope, COSI is inherently sensitive to the polarization of gamma-ray sources in the energy range 0.2-5.0 MeV. We measured the polarization of GRB 160530A using (1) a standard method (SM) based on fitting the distribution of azimuthal scattering angles with a modulation curve and (2) an unbinned, maximum likelihood method (MLM). In both cases, the measured polarization level was below the 99% confidence minimum detectable polarization levels of 72.3% {\textpm} 0.8% (SM) and 57.5% {\textpm} 0.8% (MLM). Therefore, COSI did not detect polarized gamma-ray emission from this burst. Our most constraining 90% confidence upper limit on the polarization level was 46% (MLM).},

abstract = {The measured intensities of certain gamma rays of specific energies escaping from a planetary surface can be used to determine the abundances of a number of elements. The fluxes of the more intense gamma-ray lines emitted from 32 elements were calculated using current nuclear data and existing models for the source processes. The source strengths for neutron-capture reactions were modified from those previously used. The fluxes emitted form a surface of average lunar composition are reported for 292 gamma-ray lines. These theoretical fluxes were used elsewhere to convert the data from the Apollo gamma-ray spectrometers to elemental abundances and can be used with measurements from future missions to map the concentrations of a number of elements over a planet's surface. Detection sensitivities for these elements are examined and applications of gamma-ray spectroscopy for future orbiters to Mars and other solar-system objects are discussed.},

abstract = {We present a catalog of the 26 currently known magnetars and magnetar candidates. We tabulate astrometric and timing data for all catalog sources, as well as their observed radiative properties, particularly the spectral parameters of the quiescent X-ray emission. We show histograms of the spatial and timing properties of the magnetars, comparing them with the known pulsar population, and we investigate and plot possible correlations between their timing, X-ray, and multiwavelength properties. We find the scale height of magnetars to be in the range of 20-31 pc, assuming they are exponentially distributed. This range is smaller than that measured for OB stars, providing evidence that magnetars are born from the most massive O stars. From the same fits, we find that the Sun lies {\textasciitilde}13-22 pc above the Galactic plane, consistent with previous measurements. We confirm previously identified correlations between quiescent X-ray luminosity, L X, and magnetic field, B, as well as X-ray spectral power-law indexes, $\Gamma$ and B, and show evidence for an excluded region in a plot of L X versus $\Gamma$. We also present an updated kT versus characteristic age plot, showing that magnetars and high-B radio pulsars are hotter than lower-B neutron stars of similar age. Finally, we observe a striking difference between magnetars detected in the hard X-ray and radio bands; there is a clear correlation between the hard and soft X-ray fluxes, whereas the radio-detected magnetars all have low, soft X-ray flux, suggesting, if anything, that the two bands are anticorrelated. .},

The origin of these positrons, which annihilate to produce a prominent emission line centred at 511 keV, has remained mysterious since their discovery almost 50 yr ago. A plausible origin for the positrons is in association with the intense star formation ongoing in the Galactic centre. Moreover, there is strong evidence for a nuclear outflow in the Milky Way. We find that advective transport and subsequent annihilation of positrons in such an outflow cannot simultaneously replicate the observed morphology of positron annihilation in the Galactic bulge and satisfy the requirement that 90 per cent of positrons annihilate once the outflow has cooled to 104 K.},

abstract = {Measurements of the 0.511 MeV positron-annihilation line from solar flares are used to explore the flare process in general and ion acceleration in particular. In flares, positrons are produced primarily by the decay of radioactive positron-emitting isotopes resulting from nuclear interactions of flare-accelerated ions with ambient solar material. Kozlovsky et al. provided ion-energy-dependent production cross sections for 67 positron emitters evaluated from their threshold energies (some <1 MeV nucleon-1) to a GeV nucleon-1, incorporating them into a computer code for calculating positron-emitter production. Adequate cross-section measurements were available for proton reactions, but not for $\alpha$-particle reactions where only crude estimates were possible. Here we re-evaluate the $\alpha$-particle cross sections using new measurements and nuclear reaction codes. In typical large gamma-ray line flares, proton reactions dominate positron production, but $\alpha$-particle reactions will dominate for steeper accelerated-ion spectra because of their relatively low threshold energies. With the accelerated-3He reactions added previously, the code is now reliable for calculating positron production from any distribution of accelerated-ion energies, not just those of typical flares. We have made the code available in the online version of the Journal. We investigate which reactions, projectiles, and ion energies contribute to positron production. We calculate ratios of the annihilation-line fluence to fluences of other gamma-ray lines. Such ratios can be used in interpreting flare data and in determining which nuclear radiation is most sensitive for revealing acceleration of low-energy ions at the Sun.},

This includes usage of SciPy in almost half of all machine learning projects on GitHub, and usage by high profile projects including LIGO gravitational wave analysis and creation of the first-ever image of a black hole (M87). The library includes functionality spanning clustering, Fourier transforms, integration, interpolation, file I/O, linear algebra, image processing, orthogonal distance regression, minimization algorithms, signal processing, sparse matrix handling, computational geometry, and statistics.

abstract = {We report the discovery of a new highly magnetic DA white dwarf, RE J0317-853, through its detection as an EUV source by the ROSAT Wide Field Camera. A combination of far-UV and optical spectra indicates that the star has an effective temperature {\textasciitilde}=50000K, making it the hottest known white dwarf with a measurable magnetic field. Furthermore, the magnetic field is exceptionally intense, having a value {\textasciitilde}=340 MG, sufficient to shift and broaden the Balmer line features almost beyond recognition. A field of this value is also among the highest known. While these parameters already make this star unique, we have also found that, alone among the magnetic DA white dwarfs, it is a large-amplitude ({\textasciitilde}=+/-0.1 mag) oscillator at optical wavelengths with a period of 725.4s. Since there is no known pulsational instability strip in this temperature range, the most plausible explanation is that the modulation of the optical flux is due to rotation of the star. If the star is at the same distance as another DA star, some 16 arcsec away, it must have an unusually small radius and, consequently, a mass approaching the Chandrasekhar limit. The two stars would also comprise one of only three known visual double degenerate systems with hot white dwarf components. ROSAT data indicate that heavy elements detected in the IUE spectrum are mainly attributable to circumstellar material, and we suggest this may arise from a wind driven by cyclotron radiation pressure from the intense magnetic field.},

abstract = {Analysis of spectra obtained with the gamma-ray spectrometer SPI onboard INTEGRAL of the GOES X17-class flare on October 28, 2003 is presented. In the energy range 600 keV{\textendash}8 MeV three prominent narrow lines at 2.223, 4.4 and 6.1 MeV, resulting from nuclear interactions of accelerated ions within the solar atmosphere could be observed. Time profiles of the three lines and the underlying continuum indicate distinct phases with several emission peaks and varying continuum-to-line ratio for several minutes before a smoother decay phase sets in. Due to the high-resolution Ge detectors of SPI and the exceptional intensity of the flare, detailed studies of the 4.4 and 6.1 MeV line shapes was possible for the first time. Comparison with calculated line shapes using a thick target interaction model and several energetic particle angular distributions indicates that the nuclear interactions were induced by downward-directed particle beams with alpha-to-proton ratios of the order of 0.1. There are also indications that the 4.4 MeV to 6.1 MeV line fluence ratio changed between the beginning and the decay phase of the flare, possibly due to a temporal evolution of the energetic particle alpha-to-proton ratio.},

All oxygen isotope compositions plot within {\textpm}0.016 per mil (2 standard deviations) on a single mass-dependent fractionation line that is identical to the terrestrial fractionation line within uncertainties. This observation is consistent with the Giant Impact model, provided that the proto-Earth and the smaller impactor planet (named Theia) formed from an identical mix of components. The similarity between the proto-Earth and Theia is consistent with formation at about the same heliocentric distance. The three oxygen isotopes ($\Delta$<sup>17</sup>O) provide no evidence that isotopic heterogeneity on the Moon was created by lunar impacts.</p>},

Interestingly, in the globular clusters M15, NGC 6397 and 5904, millisecond pulsars (MSPs) have been found in the radio or X-ray, which strongly support the MSP origin of the gamma-ray emission. Owing to the relatively low luminosity of the gamma-ray emission, however, we do not find any evidence for gamma-ray pulsation or flux variability in these sources.},

abstract = {Auroral hot spots are observed across the Universe at different scales1 and mark the coupling between a surrounding plasma environment and an atmosphere. Within our own Solar System, Jupiter possesses the only resolvable example of this large-scale energy transfer. Jupiter's northern X-ray aurora is concentrated into a hot spot, which is located at the most poleward regions of the planet's aurora and pulses either periodically2,3 or irregularly4,5. X-ray emission line spectra demonstrate that Jupiter's northern hot spot is produced by high charge-state oxygen, sulfur and/or carbon ions with an energy of tens of MeV (refs 4-6) that are undergoing charge exchange. Observations instead failed to reveal a similar feature in the south2,3,7,8. Here, we report the existence of a persistent southern X-ray hot spot. Surprisingly, this large-scale southern auroral structure behaves independently of its northern counterpart. Using XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray campaigns, performed in May-June 2016 and March 2007, we show that Jupiter's northern and southern spots each exhibit different characteristics, such as different periodic pulsations and uncorrelated changes in brightness. These observations imply that highly energetic, non-conjugate magnetospheric processes sometimes drive the polar regions of Jupiter's dayside magnetosphere. This is in contrast to current models of X-ray generation for Jupiter9,10. Understanding the behaviour and drivers of Jupiter's pair of hot spots is critical to the use of X-rays as diagnostics of the wide range of rapidly rotating celestial bodies that exhibit these auroral phenomena.},

abstract = {We use the open clusters (OCs) with known parameters available in the WEBDA database and in recently published papers to derive properties related to the disk structure such as the thin-disk scale height, displacement of the Sun above the Galactic plane, scale length and the OC age-distribution function. The sample totals 654 OCs, consisting basically of Trumpler types I to III clusters whose spatial distribution traces out the local geometry of the Galaxy. We find that the population of OCs with ages younger than 200 Myr distributes in the disk following an exponential-decay profile with a scale height of zh=48{\textpm}3 pc. For the clusters with ages in the range 200 Myr to 1 Gyr we derive zh=150{\textpm}27 pc. Clusters older than 1 Gyr distribute nearly uniformly in height from the plane so that no scale height can be derived from exponential fits. Considering clusters of all ages we obtain an average scale height of zh=57{\textpm}3 pc. We confirm previous results that zh increases with Galactocentric distance. The scale height implied by the OCs younger than 1 Gyr outside the Solar circle is a factor {\~{ }}1.4-2 larger than zh of those interior to the Solar circle. We derive the displacement of the Sun above the Galactic plane as z⊙=14.8{\textpm}2.4 pc, which agrees with previous determinations using stars. As a consequence of the completeness effects, the observed radial distribution of OCs with respect to Galactocentric distance does not follow the expected exponential profile, instead it falls off both for regions external to the Solar circle and more sharply towards the Galactic center. We simulate the effects of completeness assuming that the observed distribution of the number of OCs with a given number of stars above the background, measured in a restricted zone outside the Solar circle, is representative of the intrinsic distribution of OCs throughout the Galaxy. Two simulation models are considered in which the intrinsic number of observable stars are distributed: (i) assuming the actual positions of the OCs in the sample, and (ii) random selection of OC positions. As a result we derive completeness-corrected radial distributions which agree with exponential disks throughout the observed Galactocentric distance range 5-14 kpc, with scale lengths in the range RD=1.5-1.9 kpc, smaller than those inferred by means of stars. In particular we retrieve the expected exponential-disk radial profile for the highly depleted regions internal to the Solar circle. The smaller values of RD may reflect intrinsic differences in the spatial distributions of OCs and stars. We derive a number-density of Solar-neighbourhood (with distances from the Sun d⊙$\le$1.3 kpc) OCs of $\rho$⊙=795{\textpm}70 kpc-3, which implies a total number of (Trumpler types I to III) OCs of {\~{ }}730 of which {\~{ }}47% would already have been observed. Extrapolation of the completeness-corrected radial distributions down to the Galactic center indicates a total number of OCs in the range (1.8-3.7){\texttimes}105. These estimates are upper-limits because they do not take into account depletion in the number of OCs by dynamical effects in the inner parts of the Galaxy. The observed and completeness-corrected age-distributions of the OCs can be fitted by a combination of two exponential-decay profiles which can be identified with the young and old OC populations, characterized by age scales of {\~{ }}100 Myr and {\~{ }}1.9 Gyr, respectively. This rules out evolutionary scenarios based on constant star-formation and OC-disruption rates. Comparing the number of observed embedded clusters and candidates in the literature with the expected fraction of very young OCs, derived from the observed age-distribution function, we estimate that 3.4-8% of the embedded clusters do actually emerge from the parent molecular clouds as OCs.},

abstract = {The high positron production rate required to explain the flux of 511 keV gamma rays from the Galactic center has inspired many models in which dark matter creates positrons. These models include the annihilation of light dark matter and the scattering of dark matter with excited states (exciting dark matter). We show that existing cosmic microwave background data robustly constrain such models when the annihilation or scattering cross section is not velocity suppressed depending on the model of the Galactic dark matter halo. Upcoming data from the Planck mission can exclude the fiducial Via Lactea II halo model, which also provides a good fit to the 511 keV morphology. We additionally find combined constraints on exciting dark matter scattering and annihilation, and update constraints on the lifetimes of dark matter excited states. Finally, we apply constraints to models of dark matter decay in which produced positrons fall into the Galactic center and produce the 511 keV signal on their annihilation, demonstrating that most of the parameter space of interest is ruled out.},

abstract = {Aims: We study the spectrum of the cosmic X-ray background (CXB) in energy range {\textasciitilde}5-100 keV. Methods: Early in 2006 the INTEGRAL observatory performed a series of four 30 ks observations with the Earth disk crossing the field of view of the instruments. The modulation of the aperture flux due to occultation of extragalactic objects by the Earth disk was used to obtain the spectrum of the Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB). Various sources of contamination were evaluated, including compact sources, Galactic Ridge emission, CXB reflection by the Earth atmosphere, cosmic ray induced emission by the Earth atmosphere and the Earth auroral emission. Results: The spectrum of the cosmic X-ray background in the energy band 5-100 keV is obtained. The shape of the spectrum is consistent with that obtained previously by the HEAO-1 observatory, while the normalization is {\textasciitilde}10% higher. This difference in normalization can (at least partly) be traced to the different assumptions on the absolute flux from the Crab Nebulae. The increase relative to the earlier adopted value of the absolute flux of the CXB near the energy of maximum luminosity (20-50 keV) has direct implications for the energy release of supermassive black holes in the Universe and their growth at the epoch of the CXB origin.},

abstract = {We study the field millisecond pulsar (MSP) population to infer its intrinsic distribution in spin period and luminosity and to determine its spatial distribution within the Galaxy. Our likelihood analysis on data from extant surveys (22 pulsars with periods less than 20 ms) accounts for the following important selection effects: (1) the survey sensitivity as a function of direction, spin period, and sky coverage; (2) interstellar scintillation, which modulates the pulsed flux and causes a net increase in search volume of {\textasciitilde}30% and (3) errors in the pulsar distance scale. Adopting power-law models (with cutoffs) for the intrinsic distributions, the analysis yields a minimum-period cutoff Pmin > 0.65 ms (99% confidence), a period distribution proportional to P-2.0+/-0.33, and a pseudoluminosity distribution proportional to L-2.0+/-0.2p (where Lp is the product of the flux density and the square of the distance, for Lp >= 1.1 mJy kpc2). We find that the column density of MSPs (uncorrected for beaming effects) is {\textasciitilde}50+30-20 kpc-2 in the vicinity of the solar system. For a Gaussian model, the z scale height is 0.65+0.16-0.12 kpc, corresponding to the local number density 29+17-11 kpc-3. (For an exponential model, the scale height becomes 0.50+0.19-0.13 kpc, and the number density 44+25-16 kpc-3.) Estimates of the total number of MSPs in the disk of the Galaxy and for the associated birthrate are given. The contribution of a diffuse halo-like component (tracing the Galactic spheroid, the halo, or the globular cluster density profile) to the local number density of MSPs is limited to <{\textasciitilde}1% of the midplane value. We consider a kinematic model for the MSP spatial distribution in which objects in the disk are kicked once at birth and then orbit in a smooth Galactic potential, becoming dynamically well-mixed. The analysis yields a column density 49+27-17 kpc-2 (comparable to the above), a birth z kick velocity 52+17-11 km s-1, and a three-dimensional velocity dispersion of {\textasciitilde}84 km s-1. MSP velocities are smaller than those of young, long-period pulsars by about a factor of 5. The kinematic properties of the MSP population are discussed, including expected transverse motions, the occurrence of asymmetric drift, the shape of the velocity ellipsoid, and the z scale height at birth. If MSPs are long-lived, then a significant contribution to observed MSP z velocities is the result of diffusive processes that increase the scale height of old stellar populations; our best estimate of the one-dimensional velocity kick that is unique to MSP evolution is {\textasciitilde}40 km s-1 if such diffusion is taken into account. The scale heights of millisecond pulsars and low-mass X-ray binaries are consistent, suggesting a common origin and that the primary channel for forming both classes of objects imparts only low velocities. Binaries involving a common envelope phase and a neutron star-forming supernova explosion can yield such objects, even with explosion asymmetries like those needed to provide the velocity distribution of isolated, nonspun-up radio pulsars. Future searches for MSPs may be optimized using the model results. As an example, we give the expected number of detectable MSPs per beam area and the volumes of the Galaxy sampled per beam area for a hypothetical Green Bank Telescope all sky survey. Estimates for the volume that must be surveyed to find a pulsar faster than 1.5 ms are given. We also briefly discuss how selection effects associated with fast binaries influence our results.},

abstract = {Nova explosions occur on the white dwarf (WD) component of a cataclysmic variable binary stellar system which is accreting matter lost by its companion. When sufficient material has been accreted by the WD, a thermonuclear runaway (TNR) occurs and ejects material in what is observed as a classical nova (CN) explosion. We have continued our studies of TNRs on 1.25 M sun and 1.35 M sun WDs (ONeMg composition) under conditions which produce mass ejection and a rapid increase in the emitted light, by examining the effects of changes in the nuclear reaction rates on both the observable features and the nucleosynthesis during the outburst. In order to improve our calculations over previous work, we have incorporated a modern nuclear reaction network into our one-dimensional, fully implicit, hydrodynamic computer code. We find that the updates in the nuclear reaction rate libraries change the amount of ejected mass, peak luminosity, and the resulting nucleosynthesis. Because the evolutionary sequences on the 1.35 M sun WD reach higher temperatures, the effects of library changes are more important for this mass. In addition, as a result of our improvements, we discovered that the pep reaction (p + e - + p {\textrightarrow} d + $\nu$) was not included in our previous studies of CN explosions (or to the best of our knowledge those of other investigators). Although the energy production from this reaction is not important in the Sun, the densities in WD envelopes can exceed 104 g cm-3 and the presence of this reaction increases the energy generation during the time that the p-p chain is operating. Since it is only the p-p chain that is operating during most of the accretion phase prior to the final rise to the TNR, the effect of the increased energy generation is to reduce the evolution time to the peak of the TNR and, thereby, the accreted mass as compared to the evolutionary sequences done without this reaction included. As expected from our previous work, the reduction in accreted mass has important consequences on the characteristics of the resulting TNR and is discussed in this paper.},

It is found that the continuum spectrum of the compact source shows no evidence for orthopositronium annihilation. It is suggested that all of the three-photon orthopositronium continuum observed so far originates from the diffuse interstellar component. The continuum spectrum of the compact source is very similar to that of the black-hole candidate Cygnus X-1, supporting our earlier arguments that this object, at or near the Galactic center, is a black hole of stellar mass.},

From knowledge of the lunar topography and Earth, Moon, and spacecraft ephemerides at the epoch of the event, we determined the source position with an accuracy of 40 mas (1$\sigma$ c.l.), which is interesting, given the very poor imaging capabilities of RXTE ({\textasciitilde}1{\textdegree}). For the first time, using a non-imaging X-ray observatory, the position of an X-ray source with a subarcsecond accuracy is derived, demonstrating the neat capabilities of a technique that can be fruitfully applied to current and future X-ray missions.},

abstract = {Non-Euclidean geometry, discovered by negating Euclid's parallel postulate, has been of considerable interest in mathematics and related fields for the description of geographical coordinates, Internet infrastructures, and the general theory of relativity. Notably, an infinite number of regular tessellations in hyperbolic geometry---hyperbolic lattices---are expected to extend Euclidean Bravais lattices and the consequent wave phenomena to non-Euclidean geometry. However, topological states of matter in hyperbolic lattices have yet to be reported. Here we investigate topological phenomena in hyperbolic geometry, exploring how the quantized curvature and edge dominance of the geometry affect topological phases. We report a recipe for the construction of a Euclidean photonic platform that inherits the topological band properties of a hyperbolic lattice under a uniform, pseudospin-dependent magnetic field, realizing a non-Euclidean analog of the quantum spin Hall effect. For hyperbolic lattices with different quantized curvatures, we examine the topological protection of helical edge states and generalize Hofstadter's butterfly, by employing two empirical parameters that measure the edge confinement and defect immunity. We demonstrate that the proposed platforms exhibit the unique spectral-magnetic sensitivity of topological immunity in highly curved hyperbolic planes.

abstract = {J-factors (or D-factors) describe the distribution of dark matter in an astrophysical system and determine the strength of the signal provided by annihilating (or decaying) dark matter respectively. We provide simple analytic formulas to calculate the J-factors for spherical cusps obeying the empirical relationship between enclosed mass, velocity dispersion and half-light radius. We extend the calculation to the spherical Navarro-Frenk-White model, and demonstrate that our new formulas give accurate results in comparison to more elaborate Jeans models driven by Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Of the known ultrafaint dwarf spheroidals, we show that Ursa Major II, Reticulum II, Tucana II and Horologium I have the largest J-factors and so provide the most promising candidates for indirect dark matter detection experiments. Amongst the classical dwarfs, Draco, Sculptor and Ursa Minor have the highest J-factors. We show that the behavior of the J-factor as a function of integration angle can be inferred for general dark halo models with inner slope $\ensuremath{\gamma}$ and outer slope $\ensuremath{\beta}$. The central and asymptotic behavior of the J-factor curves are derived as a function of the dark halo properties. Finally, we show that models obeying the empirical relation on enclosed mass and velocity dispersion have J-factors that are most robust at the integration angle equal to the projected half-light radius of the dwarf spheroidal (dSph) divided by heliocentric distance. For most of our results, we give the extension to the D-factor which is appropriate for the decaying dark matter picture.},

abstract = {Context. The diffuse gamma-ray emission of 26Al at 1.8 MeV reflects ongoing nucleosynthesis in the Milky Way and traces massive-star feedback in the interstellar medium due to its 1 Myr radioactive lifetime. The morphology and dynamics of the interstellar medium are investigated in astrophysics through 3D hydrodynamic simulations in fine detail as there are few suitable astronomical probes available. Aims: We aim to compare a galactic-scale hydrodynamic simulation of the Galaxy's interstellar medium, including feedback and nucleosynthesis, with gamma-ray data on 26Al emission in the Milky Way, extracting constraints that are only weakly dependent on the particular realisation of the simulation or Galaxy structure. Methods: Due to constraints and biases in both the simulations and the gamma-ray observations, such comparisons are not straightforward. For a direct comparison, we performed maximum likelihood fits of both simulated sky maps and observation-based maximum entropy maps to measurements using INTEGRAL/SPI. In order to study general morphological properties, we compare the scale heights of 26Al emission produced by the simulation to INTEGRAL/SPI measurements. Results: The direct comparison shows that the simulation describes the observed inner Galaxy well, however it differs significantly from the observed full-sky emission morphology. Comparing the scale height distribution, we see similarities for small-scale height features and a mismatch at larger-scale heights. We attribute this to prominent foreground emission sites which are not captured by the simulation.},

abstract = {Gravitational wave transients, resulting from the merger of two stellar remnants, are now detectable. The properties and rates of these directly relates to the stellar population which gave rise to their progenitors, and thus to other electromagnetic transients which result from stellar death. We aim to estimate simultaneously the event rates and delay-time distribution of gravitational wave-driven compact object mergers together with the rates of core collapse and thermonuclear supernovae within a single consistent stellar population synthesis paradigm. We combine event delay-time distributions at different metallicities from the Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis models with an analytic model of the volume-averaged cosmic star formation rate density and chemical evolution to determine the volume-averaged rates of each event rate at the current time. We estimate rates in excellent agreement with extant observational constraints on core-collapse supernovae, thermonuclear supernovae, and Long Gamma-Ray bursts. We predict rates for gravitational wave mergers based on the same stellar populations, and find rates consistent with current LIGO estimates. We note that tighter constraints on the rates of these events will be required before it is possible to determine their redshift evolution, progenitor metallicity dependence, or constrain uncertain aspects of stellar evolution.},

Recent determinations of the pulsar distribution have made the discrepancy even more apparent. The problem is shown to be plausibly solved by a variation in the WCO-to-N(H2) scaling factor. If this factor increases by a factor of 5-10 from the inner to the outer Galaxy, as expected from the Galactic metallicity gradient, we show that the source distribution required to match the radial gradient of $\gamma$-rays can be reconciled with the distribution of supernova remnants as traced by current studies of pulsars. The resulting model fits the EGRET $\gamma$-ray profiles extremely well in longitude, and reproduces the mid-latitude inner Galaxy intensities better than previous models.},

Including all known point sources and a template of emission associated with interactions of cosmic rays with molecular gas, we show that the extended emission observed previously in the Fermi Large Area Telescope data toward the Galactic Center is detected at high significance for all permutations of the diffuse model components. However, we find that the fluxes and spectra of the sources in our model change significantly depending on the background model. In particular, the spectrum of the central Sgr A* source is less steep than in previous works and the recovered spectrum of the extended emission has large systematic uncertainties, especially at lower energies. If the extended emission is interpreted to be due to dark matter annihilation, we find annihilation into pure b-quark and $\tau$-lepton channels to be statistically equivalent goodness of fits. In the case of the pure b-quark channel, we find a dark matter mass of 39.4(+3.7/-2.9 stat)({\textpm}7.9 sys) GeV, while a pure $\tau$+$\tau$--channel case has an estimated dark matter mass of 9.43(+0.63/-0.52stat)({\textpm}1.2 sys) GeV. Alternatively, if the extended emission is interpreted to be astrophysical in origin such as due to unresolved millisecond pulsars, we obtain strong bounds on dark matter annihilation, although systematic uncertainties due to the dependence on the background models are significant.},

abstract = {Auroras are (generally) high-latitude atmospheric emissions that result from the precipitation of energetic charged particles from a planet's magnetosphere. Auroral emissions from the giant planets have been observed from ground-based observatories, Earth-orbiting satellites (e.g., International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE), Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and R{\"o}entgensatellit (ROSAT)), flyby spacecraft (e.g., Voyager 1 and 2), and orbiting spacecraft platforms (e.g., Galileo) at X-ray, ultraviolet (UV), visible, infrared (IR), and radio wavelengths. UV, visible, and IR auroras are atmospheric emissions, produced or initiated when ambient atmospheric species are excited through collisions with the precipitating particles, while radio and X-ray auroras are beam emissions, produced by the precipitating species themselves. The emissions at different wavelengths provide unique and complementary information, accessible to remote sensing, about the key physical processes operating in the atmospheric and magnetospheric regions where they originate. This paper reviews the development of our current understanding of auroral emissions from Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, as revealed through multispectral observations and supplemented by plasma measurements.},

abstract = {A new optical reddening model for the Solar neighborhood is presented. The model makes use of the large-scale properties of the dust layer in the Galaxy, and of the observed clumpiness in its distribution, and it is used to compute starcounts in the plane of the Galaxy, which are compared to the observed counts from the Guide Star Catalogue (GSC) for a few representative regions having a range of reddening values. These comparisons provide a good test case in a wide variety of conditions with regards to both the amount and distribution of the reddening material along the line-of-sight. This is the first systematic study of low-Galactic latitude starcounts from the perspective of a Galactic structure and reddening model, and it is demonstrated that the model can be used to obtain meaningful starcount estimates in the plane of the Milky-Way. We find that it is possible to predict starcounts in the range 8 <= V< 13.7 with a mean accuracy of 15% or better for total samples of several thousand stars at |b| < 10(degr ) , and for total reddening at 1 kpc of up to E(B-V) {\textasciitilde} 0.7 mag. Self-consistency checks indicate that a differential optical absorption of 0.5 mag/kpc is adequate to reproduce, with our model, the available reddening maps in the distance range 2 <= r <= 6 kpc. Our best-fit model to three (out of six) selected regions yields a distance of the Sun from the symmetry plane of the Galaxy of Z_⊙=27 +/- 3 (3 sigma ) pc, while the disk's scale-length is found to be H_Disk= 6 +/- 2 (3sigma ) kpc. While the derived value for Z_⊙ is quite sensitive to the adopted scale-height of disk stars, no big dependency of H_Disk on this parameter is found. These values should be taken, of course, with caution because of the inherent uncertainties in modeling optical starcounts in the presence of patchy reddening material. The accuracy of the reddening and starcounts model opens the possibility of using it to estimate and compare observations of diffuse starlight to constrain the major structural parameters of the Galaxy, and to compute the distance distribution of stars self-consistently with the starcounts, in order to derive corrections to absolute parallax.},

abstract = {The radioactive decay of the freshly synthesized r-process nuclei ejected in compact binary mergers power optical/infrared macronovae (kilonovae) that follow these events. The light curves depend critically on the energy partition among the different products of the radioactive decay and this plays an important role in estimates of the amount of ejected r-process elements from a given observed signal. We study the energy partition and $\gamma$-ray emission of the radioactive decay. We show that 20-50% of the total radioactive energy is released in $\gamma$-rays on timescales from hours to a month. The number of emitted $\gamma$-rays per unit energy interval has roughly a flat spectrum between a few dozen keV and 1 MeV so that most of this energy is carried by 1 MeV $\gamma$-rays. However at the peak of macronova emission the optical depth of the $\gamma$-rays is 0.02 and most of the $\gamma$-rays escape. The loss of these $\gamma$-rays reduces the heat deposition into the ejecta and hence reduces the expected macronova signals if those are lanthanides dominated. This implies that the ejected mass is larger by a factor of 2-3 than what was previously estimated. Spontaneous fission heats up the ejecta and the heating rate can increase if a sufficient amount of transuranic nuclei are synthesized. Direct measurements of these escaping $\gamma$-rays may provide the ultimate proof for the macronova mechanisms and an identification of the r-process nucleosynthesis sites. However, the chances to detect these signals are slim with current X-ray and $\gamma$-ray missions. New detectors, more sensitive by at least a factor of ten, are needed for a realistic detection rate.},

abstract = {The Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) is the first focusing hard X-ray telescope operating in the 3-79 keV band with sub-arcminute angular resolution (18" FWHM). For the first time, NuSTAR provides sufficient sensitivity to detect/resolve hard X-ray emission from Jupiter above 10 keV, since the in-situ Ulysses observation failed to detect X-ray emission in the 27-48 keV band [Hurley et al. 1993]. The initial, exploratory NuSTAR observation of Jupiter was performed in February 2015 with 100 ksec exposure. NuSTAR detected hard X-ray emission (E > 10 keV) from the south polar region at a marginally significance of 3 sigma level [Mori et al. 2016, AAS meeting poster]. This hard X-ray emission is likely an extension of the non-thermal bremsstrahlung component detected up to 7 keV by XMM-Newton [Branduardi-Raymont et al. 2007]. The Ulysses non-detection suggests there should be a spectral cutoff between 7 and 27 keV. Most intriguingly, the NuSTAR detection of hard X-ray emission from the south aurora is in contrast to the 2003 XMM-Newton observations where soft X-ray emission below 8 keV was seen from both the north and south poles [Gladstone et al. 2002]. Given the marginal, but tantalizing, hard X-ray detection of the southern Jovian aurora, a series of NuSTAR observations with total exposure of nearly half a million seconds were approved in the NuSTAR GO and DDT program. These NuSTAR observations coincided with one Juno apojove (in June 2017) and three perijoves (in May, July and September 2017), also joining the multi-wavelength campaigns of observing Jupiter coordinating with Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray telescope (below 10 keV) and HST. We will present NuSTAR imaging, spectral and timing analysis of Jupiter. NuSTAR imaging analysis will map hard X-ray emission in comparison with soft X-ray and UV images. In addition to investigating any distinctions between the soft and hard X-ray morphology of the Jovian aurorae, we will probe whether hard X-ray emission is spatially associated with the FUV auroral oval. NuSTAR spectral analysis will measure to how high an energy the non-thermal bremsstrahlung component extends, and detect an expected spectral cutoff between 7 and 27 keV. Since NuSTAR operates in the hard X-ray energy band, it probes the maximum energy of accelerating electrons in the Jovian magnetosphere.},

The emission of the close nucleus center region above 35 keV was found to be dominated up to 300 keV by the previously observed X-ray source 1E 1740.7 - 2942, situated about 48 arcmin away from the radio source Sgr A. During the October 13, 1990, observation, it was discovered that the source was exhibiting a remarkable feature in its emission spectrum (E is greater than 300 keV), which appears as a bump, reaching a maximum intensity around 500 keV, followed by an approximately 700-keV cutoff. In an observation performed the day after, this feature was absent, showing that the source had recovered its nominal state in a very short time.},

The gamma-ray emission associated with these bubbles has a significantly harder spectrum (dN/dE {\textasciitilde} E -2) than the inverse Compton emission from electrons in the Galactic disk, or the gamma rays produced by the decay of pions from proton-interstellar medium collisions. There is no significant spatial variation in the spectrum or gamma-ray intensity within the bubbles, or between the north and south bubbles. The bubbles are spatially correlated with the hard-spectrum microwave excess known as the WMAP haze; the edges of the bubbles also line up with features in the ROSAT X-ray maps at 1.5-2 keV. We argue that these Galactic gamma-ray bubbles were most likely created by some large episode of energy injection in the GC, such as past accretion events onto the central massive black hole, or a nuclear starburst in the last {\textasciitilde}10 Myr. Dark matter annihilation/decay seems unlikely to generate all the features of the bubbles and the associated signals in WMAP and ROSAT; the bubbles must be understood in order to use measurements of the diffuse gamma-ray emission in the inner Galaxy as a probe of dark matter physics. Study of the origin and evolution of the bubbles also has the potential to improve our understanding of recent energetic events in the inner Galaxy and the high-latitude cosmic ray population.},

In this work, we demonstrate via principal component analysis that the imprint of dark matter decay on the cosmic microwave background can be approximately parametrized by a single number for any given dark matter model. We develop a simple prescription for computing this model-dependent detectability factor, and demonstrate how this approach can be used to set model-independent bounds on a large class of decaying dark matter scenarios. We repeat our analysis for decay lifetimes shorter than the age of the Universe, allowing us to set constraints on metastable species other than the dark matter decaying at early times, and decays that only liberate a tiny fraction of the dark matter mass energy. We set precise bounds and validate our principal component analysis using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach and Planck 2015 data.},

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of Jupiter's X-ray (0.2-10 keV) auroral emissions as observed over two XMM-Newton revolutions in Nov. 2003 and compare it with that of an earlier observation in Apr. 2003. We discover the existence of an electron bremsstrahlung component in the aurorae, which accounts for essentially all the X-ray flux above 2 keV: its presence had been predicted but never detected for lack of sensitivity of previous X-ray missions. This bremsstrahlung component varied significantly in strength and spectral shape over the 3.5 days covered by the Nov. 2003 observation, displaying substantial hardening of the spectrum with increasing flux. This variability may be linked to the strong solar activity taking place at the time, and may be induced by changes in the acceleration mechanisms inside Jupiter's magnetosphere. As in Apr. 2003, the auroral spectra below 2 keV are best fitted by a superposition of line emission most likely originating from ion charge exchange, with OVII playing the dominant role. We still cannot resolve conclusively the ion species responsible for the lowest energy lines (around 0.3 keV), so the question of the origin of the ions (magnetospheric or solar wind) is still open. It is conceivable that both scenarios play a role in what is certainly a very complex planetary structure. High resolution spectra of the whole planet obtained with the XMM-Newton Reflection Grating Spectrometer in the range 0.5-1 keV clearly separate emission lines (mostly of iron) originating at low latitudes on Jupiter from the auroral lines due to oxygen. These are shown to possess very broad wings which imply velocities of {\textasciitilde}5000 km s^-1. Such speeds are consistent with the energies at which precipitating and charge exchanging oxygen ions are expected to be accelerated in Jupiter's magnetosphere. Overall we find good agreement between our measurements and the predictions of recently developed models of Jupiter's auroral processes.},

abstract = {The enhanced star formation in the inner 100 pc of the Galaxy launches a superwind at ∼1600 km s-1 for M82-like parameters. The ram pressure of the wind is very low compared to more powerful starburst winds. I show that halo gas stops the wind a few kpc from the Galactic Centre. I suggest that the termination shock accelerates cosmic rays, and that the resulting inverse Compton $\gamma$-rays are visible as the Fermi bubbles. The bubbles are then wind bubbles, which the starburst can inflate within 10 Myr. They can remain in steady state as long as the starburst lasts. The shock may accelerate PeV electrons and EeV protons. The bubbles may be analogues of galactic wind termination shocks in the intergalactic medium. I discuss the advantages and problems of this model. I note that any jets from Sgr A* must burrow through the starburst wind bubble before reaching the halo gas, which could affect the early evolution of such jets.},

The significance of association between the gamma-ray burst observed by INTEGRAL and GW170817 is 3.2$\sigma$, while the association between the Fermi-GBM and INTEGRAL detections is 4.2$\sigma$. GRB 170817A was detected by the SPI-ACS instrument about 2 s after the end of the GW event. We measure a fluence of (1.4 {\textpm} 0.4 {\textpm} 0.6) {\texttimes} 10-7 erg cm-2 (75-2000 keV), where, respectively, the statistical error is given at the 1$\sigma$ confidence level, and the systematic error corresponds to the uncertainty in the spectral model and instrument response. We also report on the pointed follow-up observations carried out by INTEGRAL, starting 19.5 hr after the event, and lasting for 5.4 days. We provide a stringent upper limit on any electromagnetic signal in a very broad energy range, from 3 keV to 8 MeV, constraining the soft gamma-ray afterglow flux to <7.1 {\texttimes} 10-11 erg cm-2 s-1 (80-300 keV). Exploiting the unique capabilities of INTEGRAL, we constrained the gamma-ray line emission from radioactive decays that are expected to be the principal source of the energy behind a kilonova event following a BNS coalescence. Finally, we put a stringent upper limit on any delayed bursting activity, for example, from a newly formed magnetar.},

abstract = {A type Ia supernova is thought to be a thermonuclear explosion of either a single carbon-oxygen white dwarf or a pair of merging white dwarfs. The explosion fuses a large amount of radioactive 56Ni (refs 1-3). After the explosion, the decay chain from 56Ni to 56Co to 56Fe generates $\gamma$-ray photons, which are reprocessed in the expanding ejecta and give rise to powerful optical emission. Here we report the detection of 56Co lines at energies of 847 and 1,238 kiloelectronvolts and a $\gamma$-ray continuum in the 200-400 kiloelectronvolt band from the type Ia supernova 2014J in the nearby galaxy M82. The line fluxes suggest that about 0.6 +/- 0.1 solar masses of radioactive 56Ni were synthesized during the explosion. The line broadening gives a characteristic mass-weighted ejecta expansion velocity of 10,000 +/- 3,000 kilometres per second. The observed $\gamma$-ray properties are in broad agreement with the canonical model of an explosion of a white dwarf just massive enough to be unstable to gravitational collapse, but do not exclude merger scenarios that fuse comparable amounts of 56Ni.},

abstract = {Classical and Type II Cepheids are used to reinvestigate specific properties of the Galaxy. A new Type II reddening-free Cepheid distance parametrization is formulated from Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) Cepheids (OGLE), with uncertainties typically no larger than 5-15 per cent. A distance to the Galactic centre of R0 = 7.8 +/- 0.6kpc is derived from the median distance to Type II Cepheids in the bulge (OGLE), R0 = 7.7 +/- 0.7kpc from a distance to the near side of the bulge combined with an estimated bulge radius of 1.3 +/- 0.3kpc derived from planetary nebulae. The distance of the Sun from the Galactic plane inferred from classical Cepheid variables is Zsolar = 26 +/- 3pc, a result dependent on the sample's distance and direction because of the complicating effects of Gould's Belt and warping in the Galactic disc. Classical Cepheids and young open clusters delineate consistent and obvious spiral features, although their characteristics do not match conventional pictures of the Galaxy's spiral pattern. The Sagittarius-Carina arm is confirmed as a major spiral arm that appears to originate from a different Galactic region than suggested previously. Furthermore, a major feature is observed to emanate from Cygnus-Vulpecula and may continue locally near the Sun. Significant concerns related to the effects of metallicity on the VI-based reddening-free Cepheid distance relations used here are allayed by demonstrating that the computed distances to the Galactic centre, and to several globular clusters (M54, NGC 6441, M15 and M5) and galaxies (NGC 5128 and NGC 3198) which likely host Type II Cepheids: agree with literature results to within the uncertainties. An additional empirical test is proposed to constrain any putative metallicity dependence of Cepheid distance determinations through forced matches of distance estimates to a particular galaxy using both Type II and classical Cepheids.},

Bubbles in the new catalogue have been independently measured by at least five individuals, producing consensus parameters for their position, radius, thickness, eccentricity and position angle. Citizen scientists - volunteers recruited online and taking part in this research - have independently rediscovered the locations of at least 86 per cent of three widely used catalogues of bubbles and H II regions whilst finding an order of magnitude more objects. 29 per cent of the Milky Way Project catalogue bubbles lie on the rim of a larger bubble, or have smaller bubbles located within them, opening up the possibility of better statistical studies of triggered star formation. Also outlined is the creation of a `;heat map' of star formation activity in the Galactic plane. This online resource provides a crowd-sourced map of bubbles and arcs in the Milky Way, and will enable better statistical analysis of Galactic star formation sites.},

abstract = {The mergers of compact binaries with at least one neutron star component are the potential leading sites of the production and ejection of r-process elements. Discoveries of galactic binary pulsars, short gamma-ray bursts, and gravitational-wave detections have all been constraining the rate of these events, while the gravitational wave plus broadband electromagnetic coverage of binary neutron star merger (GW170817) has also placed constraints on the properties (mass and composition) of the merger ejecta. But uncertainties and ambiguities in modeling the optical and infrared emission make it difficult to definitively measure the distribution of heavy isotopes in these mergers. In contrast, gamma rays emitted in the decay of these neutron-rich ejecta may provide a more direct measurement of the yields. We calculate the gamma production in remnants of neutron star mergers, considering two epochs: a kilonova epoch, lasting about two weeks, and a much later epoch of tens and hundreds of thousands of years after the merger. For the kilonova epoch, when the expanding ejecta is still only partially transparent to gamma radiation, we use 3D radiative transport simulations to produce the spectra. We show that the gamma-ray spectra associated with beta- and alpha-decay provide a fingerprint of the ejecta properties and, for a sufficiently nearby remnant, may be detectable, even for old remnants. We compare our gamma spectra with the potential detection limits of next generation detectors, including the Lunar Occultation Explorer (LOX), the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory (AMEGO), and the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI). We show that fission models can be discriminated via the presence of short-lived fission fragments in the remnant spectra.},

These new limits, substantially deeper than any previous ones, constrain several physical processes that could produce hard X-ray emission. These include cosmic-ray effects and the generation of axions within the solar core. The data also limit the properties of "nanoflares," a leading candidate to explain coronal heating. We find it unlikely for nanoflares involving nonthermal effects to heat the corona because such events would require a steep electron spectrum E -$\delta$ with index $\delta$>5 extending to very low energies (<1 keV), into the thermal energy range. We also use the limits to constrain the parameter space of an isothermal model and coronal thin-target emission models (power-law and kappa distributions).},

abstract = {The Compton Spectrometer and Image (COSI) is a ULDB-borne soft gamma-ray telescope (0.2-5 MeV) designed to probe the origins of Galactic positrons, uncover sites of nucleosynthesis in the Galaxy, and perform pioneering studies of gamma-ray polarization in a number of source classes. COSI uses a compact Compton telescope design, resulting from a decade of development under NASA{\textquoteright}s ROSES program - a modern take on techniques successfully pioneered by COMPTEL on CGRO. COSI performs groundbreaking science by combining improvements in sensitivity, spectral resolution, and sky coverage. The COSI instrument and flight systems have been designed for flight on NASA{\textquoteright}s 18 MCF superpressure balloon (SPB). We are now beginning a series science flights to fulfill the COSI science goals: a SPB in 2014 from Antarctica, followed by two 100-day ULDB flights from New Zealand.COSI is a wide-field survey telescope designed to perform imaging, spectroscopy, and polarization measurements. It employs a novel Compton telescope design utilizing a compact array of cross-strip germanium detectors (GeDs) to resolve individual gamma-ray interactions with high spectral and spatial resolution. The COSI array is housed in a common vacuum cryostat cooled by a mechanical cryocooler. An active CsI Shield encloses the cryostat on the sides and bottom. The FoV of the instrument covers 25% of the full sky at a given moment.The COSI instrument builds upon considerable heritage from the previous Nuclear Compton Telescope (NCT) balloon instrument that underwent a successful technology demonstration flight in June 2005 from Fort Sumner, NM, a successful {\textquotedblleft}first light{\textquotedblright} science flight from Fort Sumner in May 2009, and a launch campaign from Alice Springs, Australia in June 2010, where it unfortunately suffered a launch mishap. COSI has been upgraded from the previous NCT instrument by conversion to a detector configuration optimized for polarization sensitivity and addition of a cryocooler to remove consumables (LN2) for ULDB flights.In this talk, we will present the redesign of the COSI instrument and payload, as well as the overall flight program and science goals of our ULDB science flight program.},

abstract = {The Galactic Centre contains a supermassive black hole with a mass of 4 million suns within an environment that differs markedly from that of the Galactic disk. While the black hole is essentially quiescent in the broader context of active galactic nuclei, X-ray observations have provided evidence for energetic outbursts from its surroundings. Also, while the levels of star formation in the Galactic Centre have been approximately constant over the last few hundred Myr, there is evidence of elevated short-duration bursts, strongly influenced by interaction of the black hole with the enhanced gas density present within the ring-like Central Molecular Zone at Galactic longitude |l| < 0.7 degrees and latitude |b| < 0.2 degrees. The inner 200 pc region is characterized by large amounts of warm molecular gas, a high cosmic ray ionization rate, unusual gas chemistry, enhanced synchrotron emission, and a multitude of radio-emitting magnetised filaments, the origin of which has not been established. Here we report radio imaging that reveals bipolar bubbles spanning 1 degree x 3 degrees (140 parsecs x 430 parsecs), extending above and below the Galactic plane and apparently associated with the Galactic Centre. The structure is edge-brightened and bounded, with symmetry implying creation by an energetic event in the Galactic Centre. We estimate the age of the bubbles to be a few million years, with a total energy of 7 x 10^52 ergs. We postulate that the progenitor event was a major contributor to the increased cosmic-ray density in the Galactic Centre, and is in turn the principal source of the relativistic particles required to power the synchrotron emission of the radio filaments within and in the vicinity of the bubble cavities.},

abstract = {An investigation of the G-type stellar population with Kepler (as done by Maehara et al.) shows that less than 1 per cent of those stars show superflares. Due to the large pixel scale of Kepler ($\approx$4 arcsec px-1), it is still not clear whether the detected superflares really occur on the G-type stars. Knowing the origin of such large brightenings is important to study their frequency statistics, which are uncertain due to the low number of sun-like stars (Teff = 5600-6000 K and Prot > 10 d) which are currently considered to exhibit superflares. We present a complete Kepler data analysis of the sun-like stars KIC10524994 and KIC07133671 (the only two stars within this subsample of solar twins with flare energies larger than 1035 erg; Maehara et al.), regarding superflare properties and a study about their origin. We could detect four new superflares within the epoch Maehara et al. investigated and found 14 superflares in the remaining light curve for KIC10524994. Astrometric Kepler data of KIC07133671 show that the photocentre is shifted by 0.006 px or 25 mas during the one detected flare. Hence, the flare probably originated from another star directed towards the north-east. This lowers the superflare rate of sun-like stars (and hence the Sun) for E > 1035 erg, since this additional star is probably not solar-like.},

abstract = {Neutron star mergers (NM) are a plausible source of heavy r-process elements such as Europium, but previous chemical evolution models have either failed to reproduce the observed Europium trends for Milky Way thick disc stars (with [Fe/H] {\textasciitilde} -1) or have done so only by adopting unrealistically short merger timescales. Using analytic arguments and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that models with a single-phase interstellar medium (ISM) and metallicity-independent yields cannot reproduce observations showing [Eu/alpha] > 0 or [Eu/Fe] > [alpha/Fe] for alpha-elements such as Mg and Si. However, this problem is easily resolved if we allow for a 2-phase ISM, with hot-phase cooling times _cool of order 1 Gyr and a larger fraction of NM yields injected directly into the cold star-forming phase relative to alpha-element yields from core collapse supernovae (ccSNe). We find good agreement with observations in models with a cold phase injection ratio f_c,NM/f_c,ccSN of order 2, and a characteristic merger timescale _NM=150 Myr. We show that the observed super-solar [Eu/alpha] at intermediate metallicities implies that a significant fraction of Eu originates from NM or another source besides ccSNe, and that these non-ccSN yields are preferentially deposited in the star-forming phase of the ISM at early times.},

abstract = {<i>Context. <i/>In a previous paper we investigated the energy transfer of massive stars to the interstellar medium (ISM) as a function of time and the geometrical configuration of three massive stars via 3D-mesh-refining hydrodynamics simulations, following the complete evolution of the massive stars and their supernovaewith the exception of non-thermal processes. <i>Aims. <i/>To compare our results against observations we derivethermalX-ray properties of the ISM from our simulations and compare them to observations of superbubbles in general, to the well-studied nearby Orion-Eridanus superbubble and to the diffuse soft X-ray emission of nearby galaxies. <i>Methods. <i/>We analysed our ISM simulation results with the help of spectra for plasma temperatures between 0.1 and 10 keV and computed the spectral evolution and the spatio-temporal distribution of the hot gas.<i>Results. <i/>Despite significant input of high-temperature gas from supernovae and fast stellar winds, the resultingthermalX-ray spectra are generally very soft, with most of the emission well below 1 keV. We show that this is due to mixing triggered by resolved hydrodynamic instabilities. Supernovae enhance the X-ray luminosity of a superbubble by 1{\textendash}2 orders of magnitude for a time span of about 0.1 Myr; which is longer if a supernova occurs in a larger superbubble and shorter in higher energy bands. Peak superbubble luminosities of the order of 10<sup>36<sup/> erg s<sup>-1<sup/> are reproduced well. The strong decay of the X-ray luminosity is due to bubble expansion, hydrodynamic instabilities related to the acceleration of the superbubble{\textquoteright}s shell thanks to the sudden energy input, and subsequent mixing. We also find global oscillations of our simulated superbubbles, which produce spatial variations of the X-ray spectrum, similar to what we see in the Orion-Eridanus cavity. We calculated the fraction of energy emitted in X-rays and find that with a value of a few times 10<sup>-4<sup/>, it is about a factor of ten below the measurements for nearby galaxies.<i>Conclusions. <i/>Our models explain the observed soft spectra and peak X-ray luminosities of individual superbubbles. Each supernova event inside a superbubble produces a fairly similar heating-entrainment-cooling sequence, and the energy content of superbubbles is always determined by a specific fraction of the energy released by one supernova. For a given superbubble, soft X-rays trace the internal energy content well with moderate scatter. Some mechanism seems to delay the energy loss in real superbubbles compared to our simulations. Alternatively, some mechanism other thanthermal emission ofsuperbubbles may contribute to the soft X-ray luminosity of star-forming galaxies.},

According to our estimates, fluorescent X-ray emission excited by solar X-rays, even during flares from the active Sun, charge-exchange processes, previously invoked to explain Jupiter's X-ray aurora and cometary X-ray emission, and ion stripping by dust grains fail to account for the observed emission. On the other hand, bremsstrahlung emission of soft X-rays from nonthermal electrons in the few hundred to few thousand eV range may account for a substantial fraction of the observed X-ray flux from the IPT.},

abstract = {The SMART-1 mission has recently arrived at the Moon. Its payload includes D-CIXS, a compact X-ray spectrometer. SMART-1 is a technology evaluation mission, and D-CIXS is the first of a new generation of planetary X-ray spectrometers. Novel technologies enable new capabilities for measuring the fluorescent yield of a planetary surface or atmosphere which is illuminated by solar X-rays. During the extended SMART-1 cruise phase, observations of the Earth showed strong argon emission, providing a good source for calibration and demonstrating the potential of the technique. At the Moon, our initial observations over Mare Crisium show a first unambiguous remote sensing of calcium in the lunar regolith. Data obtained are broadly consistent with current understanding of mare and highland composition. Ground truth is provided by the returned Luna 20 and 24 sample sets.},

Using axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations with a self-consistent treatment of the dynamical cosmic ray (CR)-gas interaction, we show that the bubbles can be created with a recent active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet activity about 1-3 Myr ago, which was active for a duration of {\textasciitilde}0.1-0.5 Myr. The bipolar jets were ejected into the Galactic halo along the rotation axis of the Galaxy. Near the GC, the jets must be moderately light with a typical density contrast 0.001 <{\textasciitilde} $\eta$ <{\textasciitilde} 0.1 relative to the ambient hot gas. The jets are energetically dominated by kinetic energy, and overpressured with either CR or thermal pressure which induces lateral jet expansion, creating fat CR bubbles as observed. The sharp edges of the bubbles imply that CR diffusion across the bubble surface is strongly suppressed. The jet activity induces a strong shock, which heats and compresses the ambient gas in the Galactic halo, potentially explaining the ROSAT X-ray shell features surrounding the bubbles. The Fermi bubbles provide plausible evidence for a recent powerful AGN jet activity in our Galaxy, providing new insights into the origin of the halo CR population and the channel through which massive black holes in disk galaxies release feedback energy during their growth.},

abstract = {The ratio of the luminosity of diffuse 511 keV positron annihilation radiation, measured by INTEGRAL in its four years, from a Galactic "positron bulge" (<1.5 kpc) compared to that of the disk is {\textasciitilde}1.4. This ratio is roughly 4 times larger than that expected simply from the stellar bulge-to-disk ratio of {\textasciitilde}0.33 of the Galactic supernovae (SNe), which are thought to be the principal source of the annihilating positrons through the decay of radionuclei made by explosive nucleosynthesis in the SNe. This large discrepancy has prompted a search for new sources. Here, however, we show that the measured 511 keV luminosity ratio can be fully understood in the context of a Galactic SN origin when the differential propagation of these {\textasciitilde} MeV positrons in the various phases of the interstellar medium is taken into consideration, since these relativistic positrons must first slow down to energies <=10 eV before they can annihilate. Moreover, without propagation, none of the proposed positron sources, new or old, can explain the two basic properties on the Galactic annihilation radiation: the fraction of the annihilation that occurs through positronium formation and the ratio of the broad/narrow components of the 511 keV line. In particular, we show that in the neutral phases of the interstellar medium, which fill most of the disk (>3.5 kpc), the cascade of the magnetic turbulence, which scatters the positrons, is damped by ion-neutral friction, allowing positrons to stream along magnetic flux tubes. We find that nearly 1/2 of the positrons produced in the disk escape from it into the halo. On the other hand, we show that within the extended, or interstellar, bulge (<3.5 kpc), essentially all of the positrons are born in the hot plasmas which fill that volume. We find that the diffusion mean free path is long enough that only a negligible fraction annihilate there and {\textasciitilde}80% of them escape down into the H II and H I envelopes of molecular clouds that lie within 1.5 kpc before they slow down and annihilate, while the remaining {\textasciitilde}20% escape out into the halo and the disk beyond. This propagation accounts for the low observed annihilation radiation luminosity of the disk compared to the bulge. In addition, we show that the primary annihilation sites of the propagating positrons in both the bulge and the disk are in the warm ionized phases of the interstellar medium. Such annihilation can also account for those two basic properties of the emission, the fraction ({\textasciitilde}93% {\textpm} 7%) of annihilation via positronium and the ratio ({\textasciitilde}0.5) of broad ({\textasciitilde}5.4 keV) to narrow ({\textasciitilde}1.3 keV) components of the bulge 511 keV line emission. Moreover, we expect that the bulk of this broad line emission comes from the tilted disk region (0.5 < R < 1.5 kpc) with a very large broad/narrow flux ratio of {\textasciitilde}6, while much of the narrow line emission comes from the inner bulge (R < 0.5 kpc) with a negligible broad/narrow flux ratio. Separate spectral analyses of the 511 keV line emission from these two regions should be able to test this prediction, and further probe the structure of the interstellar medium. Lastly, we show that the asymmetry in the inner disk annihilation line flux, which has been suggested as added evidence for new sources, can also be fully understood from positron propagation and the asymmetry in the inner spiral arms as viewed from our solar perspective without any additional sources.},

abstract = {A detailed model is constructed for the disk and spheroid components of the Galaxy from which the distribution of visible stars and mass in the Galaxy is calculated. The application of star counts to the determination of galactic structure parameters is demonstrated. The possibility of detecting a halo component with the aid of star counts is also investigated quantitatively. The stellar luminosity functions and scale heights are determined from observations in the solar neighborhood. The global distribution of matter is assumed, based on studies of other galaxies, to be an exponential disk plus a de Vaucouleurs spheroid. The spheroid luminosity function is found to have the same shape as the disk luminosity function over the range of absolute magnitudes (+4 to + 12) that contributes significantly to the star counts for mV $\le$ 30. The density of spheroid stars in the solar neighborhood is 1/800 of the value for the disk. The star counts calculated using the density variation of a de Vaucouleurs spheroid are consistent with the available data; the counts predicted with the aid of a Hubble law are inconsistent with observations at more than the two-sigma level of significance. The variations of the calculated star densities with apparent magnitude, latitude, and longitude agree well with the available star count data for the observationally well studied range of 4 ≲ mV ≲ 22. The calculated (B - V) color distributions are also in good agreement with existing data. The color data also indicate that QSOs comprise only a few percent of the total number of stellar objects to mV = 22 (mB = 22.5). The spheroid component is found to be approximately spherical. The scale lengths of the Galaxy model and computed total luminosity and M/L ratios for the disk and spheroid are in agreement with observations of other Sbc galaxies. Illustrative Fig. and a table of interesting characteristics (such as the mass and luminosity contained within various radii and the escape velocity) are provided. Further ground-based observations at attainable faint magnitudes (mV $\le$ 23 mag) would be important. Star counts and (B - V) colors in several widely separated selected fields would permit a more accurate determination of the disk scale length and the spheroid star density and ellipticity. The most effective regions in which to make these observations are specified. The Galaxy model of the disk and spheroid is used to predict the star densities (in B and V) that may be observable with the aid of the Space Telescope down to very faint magnitudes. The stellar density to mV = 28 from the disk and spheroid is predicted to be 104 stars per square degree at the galactic pole. The predicted star counts are insensitive to many of the model parameters, although drastic changes in the shape of the luminosity function outside the presently determined magnitude range could produce measurable departures from the predicted star counts at faint magnitudes. The rotation curve computed solely from the disk and spheroid components decreases beyond about 10 kpc from the center of the Galaxy. A halo with even a relatively small mass density in the Solar neighborhood ($\rho$Halo (Sun) = 0.01 Msun pc-3) can give rise to a flat rotation curve. The stellar content of such a halo would be revealed by observations with Space Telescope cameras if the halo consists of main sequence stars with MV ≲ 19.0 mag (existing observations imply MVMS ≳ 14.0 mag) or faint white dwarfs with MVWD ≲ 17.5 mag (existing observations imply MVWD ≳ 13.0 mag). Existing data imply (M/L)Halo ≳650 (Solar Visual units). The results for V magnitudes are described in the main text; the corresponding results for B magnitudes are summarized in Appendix A. A table of predicted differential and integrated star counts for both V and B magnitudes is given in Appendix B. Simple formulae that reproduce to an accuracy of 15% the predicted model star densities as a function of magnitude, latitude, and longitude are also provided in Appendix B.},

abstract = {The limits imposed by photon statistics on the resolution attainable by deconvolving seeing-broadened astronomical images are investigated. By analogy with the classical Rayleigh limit for diffraction-limited images, resolution is defined as the separation of the equal component double star that can be just resolved by deconvolution. An approximate analytic theory is given that predicts the dependence of resolution thus defined on the number of detected photons, and this theory is tested by deconvolution experiments on synthetic images. The disparity for restored images between the Rayleigh criterion of resolution and the effective seeing inferred from the angular diameters of deconvolved single stars is stressed.},

abstract = {Gamma-rays are expected to be emitted during and immediately following a nova explosion due to the annihilation of positrons emitted by freshly produced short-lived radioactive isotopes. The expected gamma-ray emission is relatively short-lived and as nova explosions are unpredictable, the best chance of detecting the gamma-rays is with a wide field instrument. At the time when the flux is expected to reach its peak, most of the gamma-ray production is at depths such that the photons suffer several Compton scatterings before escaping, degrading their energy down to the hard X-ray band (10s of keV). SWIFT/BAT is a very wide field coded mask instrument working in the energy band 14-190 keV and so is very well suited to the search for such gamma-rays. A retrospective search is being made in the BAT data for evidence for gamma-ray emission from the direction of novae at around the time of their explosion. So far the only positive detection is of RS Ophiuchi and in this case the emission is probably due to shock heating.},

abstract = {Diffuse emission is often challenging since it is undetectable by most instruments, which are generally dedicated to point-source studies. The 26Al emission is a good illustration: the only available 26Al map to date has been released, more than 15 yr ago, thanks to the COMPTEL instrument. However, at the present time, the SPI spectrometer aboard the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory mission offers a unique opportunity to enrich this first result. In this paper, 2 {\texttimes} 108 s of data accumulated between 2003 and 2013 are used to perform a dedicated analysis, aiming to deeply investigate the spatial morphology of the 26Al emission. The data are first compared with several sky maps based on observations at various wavelengths to model the 26Al distribution throughout the Galaxy. For most of the distribution models, the inner Galaxy flux is compatible with a value of 3.3 {\texttimes} 10-4 photons cm-2 s-1, while the preferred template maps correspond to young stellar components such as core-collapse supernovae (SNe), Wolf-Rayet stars, and massive AGB stars. To get more details about this emission, an image reconstruction is performed using an algorithm based on the maximum-entropy method. In addition to the inner Galaxy emission, several excesses suggest that some sites of emission are linked to the spiral arm structure. Lastly, an estimation of the 60Fe line flux, assuming a spatial distribution similar to 26Al line emission, results in a 60Fe-to-26Al ratio around 0.14, which agrees with the most recent studies and with the SN explosion model predictions.},

abstract = {We report the observations of the X-ray lobes of the large Galactic source W50 associated with the two-sided jets source SS 433. The observations were made with the Position Sensitive Proportional Counter on board ROSAT. The eastern lobe has a knotty structure, with X-ray emission starting at {\textasciitilde}15' from SS 433 and peaking at {\textasciitilde}35'. Both thermal bremsstrahlung spectra with high temperatures (>=5 keV), as well as power-law spectra with flat photon index ($\Gamma$ {\textasciitilde} 1-2), gave adequate fits. With ROSAT, we also detected an additional soft X-ray emission from the eastern lobe, at {\textasciitilde}1{\textdegree} east of SS 433 and coincident with the radio ``ear.'' This region is associated with the terminal shock of the SS 433 jets. The western lobe has a similar morphology; however, the spectrum is softer, and no emission was found coincident with the western radio ``ear.'' We also report the observations of W50 with the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA), and combine the ROSAT and the ASCA data for a wide coverage of the spectra in the 0.1-10 keV energy range. We find that the spectrum from the brightest region (at {\textasciitilde}35' from SS 433) requires an additional component to account for an excess of photons in the 1-3 keV band. The total X-ray luminosity from both lobes is {\textasciitilde}1035-1036D25.5 ergs s-1. We discuss the origin of the X-rays in the model of emission from the supersonic jets of SS 433 interacting with the ambient medium, accelerating particles to very high energies, and producing a cocoon of ``hot'' shocked material. We present our interpretation in light of the correlation of X-ray emission with the map of W50 at other wavelengths.},

abstract = {Solar wind composition provides a strong source of variability for cometary X-rays. Using recently constrained composition observations from the Solar Wind Ion Composition Spectrometer on the Ulysses spacecraft (SWICS/Ulysses) and information on ion-neutral charge-transfer collisions, we model cometary X-ray emission and its variability. Fast and slow solar wind cases are adopted and compared to observations of X-ray spectra from the R{\"o}ntgen-Satellit (ROSAT) for comet Levy. The predicted and observed spectra compare most favorably for fast solar wind in optically thin conditions. Solar wind composition can be predicted as a function of the coronal temperature near its source and, consequently, cometary X-ray spectra may be predicted as a function of the solar wind's coronal temperature. Implications and additional developments necessary to unravel the compositional information contained in X-ray spectra are explored.},

abstract = {The diffuse continuum emission from the Galactic plane in the energy range 18{\textendash}1000 keV has been studied using 16 Ms of data from the SPI instrument on INTEGRAL. With such an exposure we can exploit the imaging properties of SPI to achieve a good separation of point sources from the various diffuse components. Using a candidate-source catalogue derived with IBIS on INTEGRAL and a number of sky distribution models we obtained spectra resolved in Galactic longitude. We can identify spectral components of a diffuse continuum of power law shape with index about 1.7, a positron annihilation component with a continuum from positronium and the line at 511{\textasciitilde}keV, and a second, roughly power-law component from detected point sources. Our analysis confirms the concentration of positron annihilation emission in the inner region (), the disk () being at least a factor 7 weaker in this emission. The power-law component in contrast drops by only a factor 2, showing a quite different longitude distribution and spatial origin. Detectable sources constitute about 90% of the total Galactic emission between 20 and 60{\textasciitilde}keV, but have a steeper spectrum than the diffuse emission, their contribution to the total emission dropping rapidly to a small fraction at higher energies. The spectrum of diffuse emission is compatible with RXTE and COMPTEL at lower and higher energies respectively. In the SPI energy range the flux is lower than found by OSSE, probably due to the more complete accounting for sources by SPI. The power-law emission is difficult to explain as of interstellar origin, inverse Compton giving at most 10%, and instead a population of unresolved point sources is proposed as a possible origin, AXPs with their spectral hardening above 100 keV being plausible candidates. We present a broadband spectrum of the Galactic emission from 10{\textasciitilde}keV to 100{\textasciitilde}GeV.},

Hawking radiation from PBHs with lifetime greater than the age of the Universe leaves an imprint on the CMB through modification of the ionization history and the damping of CMB anisotropies. Using a model for redshift-dependent energy injection efficiencies, we show that a combination of temperature and polarization data from Planck provides the strongest constraint on the abundance of PBHs for masses ∼1015- 1016 g , while the EGB dominates for masses ≳1016 g . Both the CMB and EGB now rule out PBHs as the dominant component of dark matter for masses ∼1016- 1017 g . Planned MeV gamma-ray observatories are ideal for further improving constraints on PBHs in this mass range.},

abstract = {Recent studies suggest that binary neutron star (NS-NS) mergers robustly produce heavy r-process nuclei above the atomic mass number A {\textasciitilde} 130 because their ejecta consist of almost pure neutrons (electron fraction of Y e < 0.1). However, the production of a small amount of the lighter r-process nuclei (A $\approx$ 90-120) conflicts with the spectroscopic results of r-process-enhanced Galactic halo stars. We present, for the first time, the result of nucleosynthesis calculations based on the fully general relativistic simulation of a NS-NS merger with approximate neutrino transport. It is found that the bulk of the dynamical ejecta are appreciably shock-heated and neutrino processed, resulting in a wide range of Y e ($\approx$0.09-0.45). The mass-averaged abundance distribution of calculated nucleosynthesis yields is in reasonable agreement with the full-mass range (A $\approx$ 90-240) of the solar r-process curve. This implies, if our model is representative of such events, that the dynamical ejecta of NS-NS mergers could be the origin of the Galactic r-process nuclei. Our result also shows that radioactive heating after {\textasciitilde}1 day from the merging, which gives rise to r-process-powered transient emission, is dominated by the $\beta$-decays of several species close to stability with precisely measured half-lives. This implies that the total radioactive heating rate for such an event can be well constrained within about a factor of two if the ejected material has a solar-like r-process pattern.},

abstract = {Context. The positron (e+) annihilation $\gamma$-ray signal in the Milky Way (MW) shows a puzzling morphology: a very bright bulge and a very low surface-brightness disk. A coherent explanation of the e+ origin, propagation through the Galaxy and subsequent annihilation in the interstellar medium has not yet been found. Tentative explanations involve e+s from radioactivity, X-ray binaries, and dark matter (DM). Aims: Dwarf satellite galaxies (DSGs) are believed to be dominated by DM and hence are promising candidates in the search for 511 keV emission as a result of DM annihilation into e+e--pairs. The goal of this study is to constrain possible 511 keV $\gamma$-ray signals from 39 DSGs of the MW and to test the annihilating DM scenario. Methods: We used the spectrometer SPI on INTEGRAL to extract individual spectra for the studied objects in the range 490-530 keV. As the diffuse galactic 511 keV emission dominates the overall signal, we modelled the large-scale morphology of the MW accordingly and included this in a maximum likelihood analysis. Alternatively, a distance-weighted stacked spectrum was determined, representing an average DSG seen in 511 keV. Results: Only Reticulum II (Ret II) shows a 3.1$\sigma$ signal. Five other sources show tentative 2$\sigma$ signals. The ratio of mass to 511 keV luminosity, $\Upsilon$511, shows a marginal trend towards higher values for intrinsically brighter objects in contrast to the mass-to-light ratio, $\Upsilon$V in the V band, which is generally used to uncover DM in DSGs. Conclusions: All derived 511 keV flux values or upper limits are above the flux level implied by a DM interpretation of the MW bulge signal. The signal detected from Ret II is unlikely to be related to a DM origin alone, otherwise, the MW bulge would be {\textasciitilde}100 times brighter in 511 keV than what is seen with SPI. Ret II is exceptional considering the DSG sample and rather points to enhanced recent star formation activity if its origins are similar to processes in the MW. Understanding this emission may provide further clues regarding the origin of the annihilation emission in the MW bulge.},

abstract = {We present and analyse a catalogue of 233 pulsars with proper motion measurements. The sample contains a wide variety of pulsars including recycled objects and those associated with globular clusters or supernova remnants. After taking the most precise proper motions for those pulsars for which multiple measurements are available, the majority of the proper motions (58 per cent) are derived from pulsar timing methods, 41 per cent using interferometers and the remaining 1 per cent using optical telescopes. Many of the one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) speeds (referring to speeds measured in one coordinate only and the magnitudes of the transverse velocities, respectively) derived from these measurements are somewhat lower than earlier estimates because of the use of the most recent electron density model in determining pulsar distances. The mean 1D speeds for the normal and recycled pulsars are 152(10) and 54(6)kms-1, respectively. The corresponding mean 2D speeds are 246(22) and 87(13)kms-1. PSRs B2011+38 and B2224+64 have the highest inferred 2D speeds of {\textasciitilde}1600 km s-1. We study the mean speeds for different subsamples and find that, in general, they agree with previous results. Applying a novel deconvolution technique to the sample of 73 pulsars with characteristic ages less than 3Myr, we find the mean three-dimensional (3D) pulsar birth velocity to be 400(40)kms-1. The distribution of velocities is well described by a Maxwellian distribution with 1D rms $\sigma$= 265 km s-1. There is no evidence for a bimodal velocity distribution. The proper motions for PSRs B1830-08 and B2334+61 are consistent with their proposed associations with the supernova remnants W41 and G114.3+0.3, respectively.},

abstract = {Some classes of stars, including novae and supernovae, undergo explosive outbursts that eject stellar material into space. In 2002, the previously unknown variable star V838 Monocerotis brightened suddenly by a factor of ∼104. Unlike a supernova or nova, it did not explosively eject its outer layers; rather, it simply expanded to become a cool supergiant with a moderate-velocity stellar wind. Superluminal light echoes were discovered1,2 as light from the outburst propagated into the surrounding, pre-existing circumstellar dust. Here we report high-resolution imaging and polarimetry of those light echoes, which allow us to set direct geometric distance limits to the object. At a distance of >6 kpc, V838 Mon at its maximum brightness was temporarily the brightest star in the Milky Way. The presence of the circumstellar dust implies that previous eruptions have occurred, and spectra show it to be a binary system. When combined with the high luminosity and unusual outburst behaviour, these characteristics indicate that V838 Mon represents a hitherto unknown type of stellar outburst, for which we have no completely satisfactory physical explanation.},

abstract = {In the classical theory black holes can only absorb and not emit particles. However it is shown that quantum mechanical effects cause black holes to create and emit particles as if they were hot bodies with temperature{hkappa }/{2$\pi$ k} $\approx$ 10^{ - 6} left( {{M_ odot }/M} right){}^ circ K where $\kappa$ is the surface gravity of the black hole. This thermal emission leads to a slow decrease in the mass of the black hole and to its eventual disappearance: any primordial black hole of mass less than about 1015 g would have evaporated by now. Although these quantum effects violate the classical law that the area of the event horizon of a black hole cannot decrease, there remains a Generalized Second Law: S+1/4 A never decreases where S is the entropy of matter outside black holes and A is the sum of the surface areas of the event horizons. This shows that gravitational collapse converts the baryons and leptons in the collapsing body into entropy. It is tempting to speculate that this might be the reason why the Universe contains so much entropy per baryon.},

abstract = {We analyzed light curves of seven relatively slower novae, PW Vul, V705 Cas, GQ Mus, RR Pic, V5558 Sgr, HR Del, and V723 Cas, based on an optically thick wind theory of nova outbursts. For fast novae, free-free emission dominates the spectrum in optical bands rather than photospheric emission, and nova optical light curves follow the universal decline law. Faster novae blow stronger winds with larger mass-loss rates. Because the brightness of free-free emission depends directly on the wind mass-loss rate, faster novae show brighter optical maxima. In slower novae, however, we must take into account photospheric emission because of their lower wind mass-loss rates. We calculated three model light curves of free-free emission, photospheric emission, and their sum for various white dwarf (WD) masses with various chemical compositions of their envelopes and fitted reasonably with observational data of optical, near-IR (NIR), and UV bands. From light curve fittings of the seven novae, we estimated their absolute magnitudes, distances, and WD masses. In PW Vul and V705 Cas, free-free emission still dominates the spectrum in the optical and NIR bands. In the very slow novae, RR Pic, V5558 Sgr, HR Del, and V723 Cas, photospheric emission dominates the spectrum rather than free-free emission, which makes a deviation from the universal decline law. We have confirmed that the absolute brightnesses of our model light curves are consistent with the distance moduli of four classical novae with known distances (GK Per, V603 Aql, RR Pic, and DQ Her). We also discussed the reason why the very slow novae are about {\textasciitilde}1 mag brighter than the proposed maximum magnitude versus rate of decline relation.},

abstract = {We present a detailed, three-dimensional hydrodynamic study of the neutrino-driven winds emerging from the remnant of a neutron star merger. Our simulations are performed with the Newtonian, Eulerian code FISH, augmented by a detailed, spectral neutrino leakage scheme that accounts for neutrino absorption. Consistent with earlier two-dimensional studies, a strong baryonic wind is blown out along the original binary rotation axis within $\approx$100 ms. From this model, we compute a lower limit on the expelled mass of 3.5 {\texttimes} 10-3 M⊙, relevant for heavy element nucleosynthesis. Because of stronger neutrino irradiation, the polar regions show substantially larger electron fractions than those at lower latitudes. The polar ejecta produce interesting r-process contributions from A $\approx$ 80 to about 130, while the more neutron-rich, lower latitude parts produce elements up to the third r-process peak near A $\approx$ 195. We calculate the properties of electromagnetic transients powered by the radioactivity in the wind, in addition to the `macronova' transient stemming from the dynamic ejecta. The polar regions produce ultraviolet/optical transients reaching luminosities up to 1041 erg s-1, which peak around 1 d in optical and 0.3 d in bolometric luminosity. The lower latitude regions, due to their contamination with high-opacity heavy elements, produce dimmer and more red signals, peaking after {\~{ }}2 d in optical and infrared.},

The broadband emission, from radio to X-rays, is well-described by a simple power-law spectrum with index {\textasciitilde}0.585 at all epochs. After an initial shallow rise {\textasciitilde}t^0.9, the afterglow displayed a smooth turn-over, reaching a peak X-ray luminosity of {\textasciitilde}5e39 erg/s at 160 d, and has now entered a phase of rapid decline {\textasciitilde}t^(-2). The latest temporal trend challenges most models of choked jet/cocoon systems, and is instead consistent with the emergence of a relativistic structured jet seen at an angle of {\textasciitilde}22 deg from its axis. Within such model, the properties of the explosion (such as its blastwave energy E_K{\textasciitilde}2E50 erg, jet width theta_c{\textasciitilde}4 deg, and ambient density n{\textasciitilde}3E-3 cm^(-3)) fit well within the range of properties of cosmological short GRBs.},

abstract = {The Moon is generally believed to have formed from debris ejected by a large off-centre collision with the early Earth1,2. The impact orientation and size are constrained by the angular momentum contained in both the Earth's spin and the Moon's orbit, a quantity that has been nearly conserved over the past 4.5 billion years. Simulations of potential moon-forming impacts now achieve resolutions sufficient to study the production of bound debris. However, identifying impacts capable of yielding the Earth{\textendash}Moon system has proved difficult3,4,5,6. Previous works4,5 found that forming the Moon with an appropriate impact angular momentum required the impact to occur when the Earth was only about half formed, a more restrictive and problematic model than that originally envisaged. Here we report a class of impacts that yield an iron-poor Moon, as well as the current masses and angular momentum of the Earth{\textendash}Moon system. This class of impacts involves a smaller{\textemdash}and thus more likely{\textemdash}object than previously considered viable, and suggests that the Moon formed near the very end of Earth's accumulation.},

abstract = {The scientific impact of current and upcoming photometric galaxy surveys is contingent on our ability to obtain redshift estimates for large numbers of faint galaxies. In the absence of spectroscopically confirmed redshifts, broad-band photometric redshift point estimates (photo-$z$s) have been superseded by photo-$z$ probability density functions (PDFs) that encapsulate their nontrivial uncertainties. Initial applications of photo-$z$ PDFs in weak gravitational lensing studies of cosmology have obtained the redshift distribution function $\mathcal{N}(z)$ by employing computationally straightforward stacking methodologies that violate the laws of probability. In response, mathematically self-consistent models of varying complexity have been proposed in an effort to answer the question, "What is the right way to obtain the redshift distribution function $\mathcal{N}(z)$ from a catalog of photo-$z$ PDFs?" This letter aims to motivate adoption of such principled methods by addressing the contrapositive of the more common presentation of such models, answering the question, "Under what conditions do traditional stacking methods successfully recover the true redshift distribution function $\mathcal{N}(z)$?" By placing stacking in a rigorous mathematical environment, we identify two such conditions: those of perfectly informative data and perfectly informative prior information. Stacking has maintained its foothold in the astronomical community for so long because the conditions in question were only weakly violated in the past. These conditions, however, will be strongly violated by future galaxy surveys. We therefore conclude that stacking must be abandoned in favor of mathematically supported methods in order to advance observational cosmology.},

abstract = {Context. The optical light curve of Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) is powered by thermalized gamma-rays produced by the decay of 56Ni and 56Co, the main radioactive isotopes synthesized by the thermonuclear explosion of a C/O white dwarf. Aims: Gamma-rays escaping the ejecta can be used as a diagnostic tool for studying the characteristics of the explosion. In particular, it is expected that the analysis of the early gamma emission, near the maximum of the optical light curve, could provide information about the distribution of the radioactive elements in the debris. Methods: The gamma data obtained from SN2014J in M 82 by the instruments on board INTEGRAL were analysed paying special attention to the effect that the detailed spectral response has on the measurements of the intensity of the lines. Results: The 158 keV emission of 56Ni has been detected in SN2014J at {\textasciitilde}5$\sigma$ at low energy with both ISGRI and SPI around the maximum of the optical light curve. After correcting the spectral response of the detector, the fluxes in the lines suggest that, in addition to the bulk of radioactive elements buried in the central layers of the debris, there is a plume of 56Ni, with a significance of {\textasciitilde}3$\sigma$, moving at high velocity and receding from the observer. The mass of the plume is in the range of {\textasciitilde}0.03-0.08 M⊙. Conclusions: No SNIa explosion model has ever predicted the mass and geometrical distribution of 56Ni suggested here. According to its optical properties, SN2014J looks like a normal SNIa, so it is extremely important to discern whether it is also representative in the gamma-ray band.

The meteoritic and solar abundances of a few elements (e.g., noble gases, beryllium, boron, phosphorous, sulfur) are discussed in detail. The photospheric abundances give mass fractions of hydrogen (X=0.7491), helium (Y=0.2377), and heavy elements (Z=0.0133), leading to Z/X=0.0177, which is lower than the widely used Z/X=0.0245 from previous compilations. Recent results from standard solar models considering helium and heavy-element settling imply that photospheric abundances and mass fractions are not equal to protosolar abundances (representative of solar system abundances). Protosolar elemental and isotopic abundances are derived from photospheric abundances by considering settling effects. Derived protosolar mass fractions are X0=0.7110, Y0=0.2741, and Z0=0.0149. The solar system and photospheric abundance tables are used to compute self-consistent sets of condensation temperatures for all elements.},

abstract = {We discuss gamma-ray signatures associated with an asymmetric explosion and transport of positrons in SN Ia ejecta. In particular, Compton scattering of gamma-ray line photons can induce polarization in the continuum, which would be a direct probe of the asymmetries in the distribution of radioactive isotopes and/or of the scattering medium. Even more interesting would be a comparison of the shapes of $\gamma$-ray lines and that of the electron-positron annihilation line at 511keV. The shapes of $\gamma$-ray lines associated with the decay of 56Co (e.g. lines at 847 and 1238keV) directly reflect the velocity distribution of 56Co. On the other hand, the 511 keV line arises from the annihilation of positions, which are also produced by the 56Co decay but can propagate through the ejecta before they slow down and annihilate. Therefore, the shape of the annihilation line might differ from other gamma-ray lines, providing constraints on the efficiency of positrons propagation through the ejecta and, as consequence, on the topology of magnetic fields in the ejecta and on the fraction of positrons that escape to the interstellar medium. We illustrate the above effects with two models aimed at capturing the main predicted signatures.},

The active region produced a medium-size solar flare 1 day before the observations, at {\~{ }}18 UT on 2014 December 10, with the post-flare loops still visible at the time of NuSTAR observations. The time evolution of the source emission in the SDO/AIA 335 {\AA} channel reveals the characteristics of an extreme-ultraviolet late-phase event, caused by the continuous formation of new post-flare loops that arch higher and higher in the solar corona. The spectral fitting of NuSTAR observations yields an isothermal source, with temperature 3.8-4.6 MK, emission measure (0.3-1.8) {\texttimes} 1046 cm-3, and density estimated at (2.5-6.0) {\texttimes} 108 cm-3. The observed AIA fluxes are consistent with the derived NuSTAR temperature range, favoring temperature values in the range of 4.0-4.3 MK. By examining the post-flare loops{\textquoteright} cooling times and energy content, we estimate that at least 12 sets of post-flare loops were formed and subsequently cooled between the onset of the flare and NuSTAR observations, with their total thermal energy content an order of magnitude larger than the energy content at flare peak time. This indicates that the standard approach of using only the flare peak time to derive the total thermal energy content of a flare can lead to a large underestimation of its value.},

abstract = {The existence of an intense narrow electron/position annihilation line from the direction of the Galactic center is unquestioned; however, the source of the positrons remains a mystery. It is believed the line emisssion has two components: one compact at or near the Galactic center, and the other extended in the equatorial plane of the Galaxy. A compact component is suggested by several reports of intensity variations, including one from our group based on HEAO 3 data. Since the original HEAO 3 analysis, our algorithms have been greatly improved and we have gained a much better understanding of systematic effects which could influence the results. Given the importance of the result and the significantly improved analysis techniques now avaiable, the data have been reanalyzed. For a single point source at the Galactic center, the revised line intensities are (1.25 +/- 0.18) x 10-3 photons cm-2 s-1 for the fall of 1979 and (0.99 +/- 0.18) x 103 photons cm-2 x-1 for the spring of 1980.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are highly luminous flashes of gamma-rays that last from hundreds of milliseconds up to hundreds of seconds, peak in the soft gamma-ray band 0.1 MeV to 1 MeV, represent ultra-relativistic motion, and originate from cosmological distances. Despite thousands of observations of GRB prompt emission, and hundreds of observations of GRB afterglows, many details pertaining to the nature of gamma-ray bursts remain elusive. A wide variety of models exist that describe the progenitors, central engines, emission mechanism, geometric structure, and magnetization of GRBs. Polarization measurements of the GRB prompt emission are believed to give essential clues where spectral and temporal observations fall short. The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a balloon borne Compton polarimeter, imager, and spectrometer sensitive in the 0.2 MeV to 5 MeV band. One of COSI's main science goals is measuring the polarization of astrophysical gamma-ray sources, including GRBs. Polarimetric measurements with a Compton polarimeter are possible due to the sensitivity of the Compton scattering cross section upon the orientation of the photon's electric field vector. We verified COSI's polarimetric capabilities in the laboratory using partially polarized and unpolarized beams, and compared the measurements to simulations. Overall, the measurements reflect the simulations closely, and we were able to place upper limits on the systematic error on the polarization level of 3%-4%. In May of 2016, COSI took flight from Wanaka, New Zealand aboard a NASA Super Pressure Balloon. COSI continuously telemetered science data for 46 days before landing in Southern Peru. On May 30, 2016, COSI clearly detected the long duration gamma-ray burst GRB 160530A. We performed a polarization analysis of this GRB using both a standard method (SM) and a maximum likelihood method (MLM). The measured polarization level was below the 99% confidence minimum detectable polarization level (MDP) using both analysis methods (MDP = 72.3% +/- 0.8% for the SM, and MDP = 57.5% +/- 0.8% for the MLM), so we claim a non-detection of polarization for this GRB. Using the MLM, we placed a 90% confidence upper limit of 46% on the polarization level. GRBs with polarization levels higher than 46% have been reported in the literature, and so this result will be useful in future meta-analyses that consider the statistical distribution of polarization levels across the GRB population.},

abstract = {Context. Tracing unstable isotopes produced in supernova nucleosynthesis provides a direct diagnostic of supernova explosion physics. Theoretical models predict an extensive variety of scenarios, which can be constrained through observations of the abundant isotopes 56Ni and 44Ti. Direct evidence of the latter was previously found only in two core-collapse supernova events, and appears to be absent in thermonuclear supernovae. Aims: We aim to to constrain the supernova progenitor types of Cassiopeia A, SN 1987A, Vela Jr., G1.9+0.3, SN1572, and SN1604 through their 44Ti ejecta masses and explosion kinematics. Methods: We analyzed INTEGRAL/SPI observations of the candidate sources utilizing an empirically motivated high-precision background model. We analyzed the three dominant spectroscopically resolved de-excitation lines at 68, 78, and 1157 keV emitted in the decay chain of 44Ti{\textrightarrow}44Sc{\textrightarrow}44Ca. The fluxes allow the determination of the production yields of 44Ti. Remnant kinematics were obtained from the Doppler characteristics of the lines. Results: We find a significant signal for Cassiopeia A in all three lines with a combined significance of 5.4$\sigma$. The fluxes are (3.3 {\textpm} 0.9) {\texttimes} 10-5 ph cm-2 s-1, and (4.2 {\textpm} 1.0) {\texttimes} 10-5 ph cm-2 s-1 for the 44Ti and 44Sc decay, respectively. This corresponds to a mass of (2.4 {\textpm} 0.7) {\texttimes} 10-4 M⊙ and (3.1 {\textpm} 0.8) {\texttimes} 10-4 M⊙, respectively. We obtain higher fluxes for 44Ti with our analysis of Cassiopeia A than were obtained in previous analyses. We discuss potential differences. We interpret the line width from Doppler broadening as expansion velocity of (6400 {\textpm} 1900) km s-1. We do not find any significant signal for any other candidate sources. Conclusions: We obtain a high 44Ti ejecta mass for Cassiopeia A that is in disagreement with ejecta yields from symmetric 2D models. Upper limits for the other core-collapse supernovae are in agreement with model predictions and previous studies. The upper limits we find for the three thermonuclear supernovae (G1.9+0.3, SN1572 and SN1604) consistently exclude the double detonation and pure helium deflagration models as progenitors.},

abstract = {e-ASTROGAM ({\textquoteleft}enhanced ASTROGAM{\textquoteright}) is a breakthrough Observatory space mission, with a detector composed by a Silicon tracker, a calorimeter, and an anticoincidence system, dedicated to the study of the non-thermal Universe in the photon energy range from 0.3 MeV to 3 GeV {\textendash} the lower energy limit can be pushed to energies as low as 150 keV, albeit with rapidly degrading angular resolution, for the tracker, and to 30 keV for calorimetric detection. The mission is based on an advanced space-proven detector technology, with unprecedented sensitivity, angular and energy resolution, combined with polarimetric capability. Thanks to its performance in the MeV-GeV domain, substantially improving its predecessors, e-ASTROGAM will open a new window on the non-thermal Universe, making pioneering observations of the most powerful Galactic and extragalactic sources, elucidating the nature of their relativistic outflows and their effects on the surroundings. With a line sensitivity in the MeV energy range one to two orders of magnitude better than previous generation instruments, e-ASTROGAM will determine the origin of key isotopes fundamental for the understanding of supernova explosion and the chemical evolution of our Galaxy. The mission will provide unique data of significant interest to a broad astronomical community, complementary to powerful observatories such as LIGO-Virgo-GEO600-KAGRA, SKA, ALMA, E-ELT, TMT, LSST, JWST, Athena, CTA, IceCube, KM3NeT, and the promise of eLISA.},

abstract = {In performing a Bayesian analysis of astronomical data, two difficult problems often emerge. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the resulting posterior distribution may be multimodal or exhibit pronounced (curving) degeneracies, which can cause problems for traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods. Secondly, in selecting between a set of competing models, calculation of the Bayesian evidence for each model is computationally expensive using existing methods such as thermodynamic integration. The nested sampling method introduced by Skilling, has greatly reduced the computational expense of calculating evidence and also produces posterior inferences as a by-product. This method has been applied successfully in cosmological applications by Mukherjee, Parkinson {\&} Liddle, but their implementation was efficient only for unimodal distributions without pronounced degeneracies. Shaw, Bridges {\&} Hobson recently introduced a clustered nested sampling method which is significantly more efficient in sampling from multimodal posteriors and also determines the expectation and variance of the final evidence from a single run of the algorithm, hence providing a further increase in efficiency. In this paper, we build on the work of Shaw et al. and present three new methods for sampling and evidence evaluation from distributions that may contain multiple modes and significant degeneracies in very high dimensions; we also present an even more efficient technique for estimating the uncertainty on the evaluated evidence. These methods lead to a further substantial improvement in sampling efficiency and robustness, and are applied to two toy problems to demonstrate the accuracy and economy of the evidence calculation and parameter estimation. Finally, we discuss the use of these methods in performing Bayesian object detection in astronomical data sets, and show that they significantly outperform existing MCMC techniques. An implementation of our methods will be publicly released shortly.},

abstract = {Context. Massive stars form in groups and their winds and supernova explosions create superbubbles up to kpc in size. The fate of their ejecta is of vital importance for the dynamics of the interstellar medium, for chemical evolution models, and the chemical enrichment of galactic halos and the intergalactic medium. However, ejecta kinematics and the characteristic scales in space and time have not been explored in great detail beyond {\textasciitilde}10 Ka. Aims: Through measurement of radioactive 26Al with its decay time constant at {\textasciitilde}106 years, we aim to trace the kinematics of cumulative massive-star and supernova ejecta independent of the uncertain gas parameters over million-year time scales. Our goal is to identify the mixing time scale and the spatio-kinematics of such ejecta from the pc to kpc scale in our Milky Way. Methods: We use the SPI spectrometer on the INTEGRAL observatory and its observations along the Galactic ridge to trace the detailed line shape systematics of the 1808.63 keV gamma-ray line from 26Al decay. We determine line centroids and compare these to Doppler shift expectations from large-scale systematic rotation around the Galaxy centre, as observed in other Galactic objects. Results: We measure the radial velocities of gas traced by 26Al, averaged over the line of sight, as a function of Galactic longitude. We find substantially higher velocities than expected from Galactic rotation, the average bulk velocity being {\textasciitilde}200 km s-1 larger than predicted from Galactic rotation. The observed radial velocity spread implies a Doppler broadening of the gamma-ray line that is consistent with our measurements of the overall line width. We can reproduce the observed characteristics with 26Al sources located along the inner spiral arms, when we add a global blow-out preference into the forward direction away from arms into the inter-arm region, as is expected when massive stars are offset towards the spiral-arm leading edge. With the known connection of superbubbles to the gaseous halo, this implies angular-momentum transfer in the disk-halo system and consequently also radial gas flows. The structure of the interstellar gas above the disk affects how ionizing radiation may escape and ionize intergalactic gas.},

abstract = {Recent observations have discovered the presence of a box/peanut or X-shape structure in the Galactic bulge. Such box/peanut structures are common in external disc galaxies, and are well known in N-body simulations where they form following the buckling instability of a bar. From studies of analytical potentials and N-body models, it has been claimed in the past that box/peanut bulges are supported by `bananas', or x1v1 orbits. We present here a set of N-body models where instead the peanut bulge is mainly supported by brezel-like orbits, allowing strong peanuts to form with short extent relative to the bar length. This shows that stars in the X-shape do not necessarily stream along banana orbits which follow the arms of the X-shape. The brezel orbits are also found to be the main orbital component supporting the peanut shape in our recent made-to-measure dynamical models of the Galactic bulge. We also show that in these models the fraction of stellar orbits that contribute to the X-structure account for 40-45 per cent of the stellar mass.},

GRO, as one of NASA's Great Observatories, will provide coordinated observation which cover six decades of energy in the gamma-ray range. OSSE has been designed to undertake comprehensive gamma-ray observations of astrophysical sources in the 0.05 to 10 MeV energy range. The instrument includes secondary capabilities for gamma-ray and neutron observations above 10 MeV that will be of particular value for solar flare studies. OSSE's observations will address a broad range of objectives in gamma ray astronomy, including a search for evidence of heavy element nucleosynthesis through observation of radioactivity in supernova remnants, and a search for the power source in novae from observations of the associated radioactivity.},

abstract = {Several experiments in high-energy physics and astrophysics can be treated as on/off measurements, where an observation potentially containing a new source or effect ("on" measurement) is contrasted with a background-only observation free of the effect ("off" measurement). In counting experiments, the significance of the new source or effect can be estimated with a widely-used formula from [LiMa], which assumes that both measurements are Poisson random variables. In this paper we study three other cases: i) the ideal case where the background measurement has no uncertainty, which can be used to study the maximum sensitivity that an instrument can achieve, ii) the case where the background estimate b in the off measurement has an additional systematic uncertainty, and iii) the case where b is a Gaussian random variable instead of a Poisson random variable. The latter case applies when b comes from a model fitted on archival or ancillary data, or from the interpolation of a function fitted on data surrounding the candidate new source/effect. Practitioners typically use in this case a formula which is only valid when b is large and when its uncertainty is very small, while we derive a general formula that can be applied in all regimes. We also develop simple methods that can be used to assess how much an estimate of significance is sensitive to systematic uncertainties on the efficiency or on the background. Examples of applications include the detection of short Gamma-Ray Bursts and of new X-ray or $\gamma$-ray sources.},

abstract = {Gamma ray spectroscopy data acquired by Lunar Prospector are used to determine global maps of the elemental composition of the lunar surface. Maps of the abundance of major oxides, MgO, Al2O3, SiO2, CaO, TiO2, and FeO, and trace incompatible elements, K and Th, are presented along with their geochemical interpretation. Linear spectral mixing is used to model the observed gamma ray spectrum for each map pixel. The spectral shape for each elemental constituent is determined by a Monte Carlo radiation transport calculation. Linearization of the mixing model is accomplished by scaling the spectral shapes with lunar surface parameters determined by neutron spectroscopy, including the number density of neutrons slowing down within the surface and the effective atomic mass of the surface materials. The association of the highlands with the feldspathic lunar meteorites is used to calibrate the mixing model and to determine backgrounds. A linear least squares approach is used to unmix measured spectra to determine the composition of each map pixel. The present analysis uses new gamma ray production cross sections for neutron interactions, resulting in improved accuracy compared to results previously submitted to the Planetary Data System. Systematic variations in lunar composition determined by the spectral unmixing analysis are compared with the lunar soil sample and meteorite collections. Significant results include improved accuracy for the abundance of Th and K in the highlands; identification of large regions, including western Procellarum, that are not well represented by the sample collection; and the association of relatively high concentrations of Mg with KREEP-rich regions on the lunar nearside, which may have implications for the concept of an early magma ocean.},

abstract = {The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has provided the most detailed view to date of the emission toward the Galactic center (GC) in high-energy $\gamma$-rays. This paper describes the analysis of data taken during the first 62 months of the mission in the energy range 1-100 GeV from a 15{\textdegree} {\texttimes} 15{\textdegree} region about the direction of the GC. Specialized interstellar emission models (IEMs) are constructed to enable the separation of the $\gamma$-ray emissions produced by cosmic ray particles interacting with the interstellar gas and radiation fields in the Milky Way into that from the inner ∼1 kpc surrounding the GC, and that from the rest of the Galaxy. A catalog of point sources for the 15{\textdegree} {\texttimes} 15{\textdegree} region is self-consistently constructed using these IEMs: the First Fermi-LAT Inner Galaxy Point Source Catalog (1FIG). The spatial locations, fluxes, and spectral properties of the 1FIG sources are presented, and compared with $\gamma$-ray point sources over the same region taken from existing catalogs. After subtracting the interstellar emission and point-source contributions a residual is found. If templates that peak toward the GC are used to model the positive residual the agreement with the data improves, but none of the additional templates tried account for all of its spatial structure. The spectrum of the positive residual modeled with these templates has a strong dependence on the choice of IEM.},

abstract = {We present a measurement of the sky distribution of positronium (Ps) annihilation continuum emission obtained with the SPI spectrometer on board ESA's INTEGRAL observatory. The only sky region from which significant Ps continuum emission is detected is the Galactic bulge. The Ps continuum emission is circularly symmetric about the Galactic centre, with an extension of about 8{\textdegree} FWHM. Within measurement uncertainties, the sky distribution of the Ps continuum emission is consistent with that found by us for the 511 keV electron-positron annihilation line using SPI. Assuming that 511 keV line and Ps continuum emission follow the same spatial distribution, we derive a Ps fraction of 0.92{\textpm}0.09. These results strengthen our conclusions regarding the origin of positrons in our Galaxy based on observations of the 511 keV line. In particular, they suggest that the main source of Galactic positrons is associated with an old stellar population, such as Type Ia supernovae, classical novae, or low-mass X-ray binaries. Light dark matter is a possible alternative source of positrons.},

We find that they are stronger than usually inferred due to two neglected effects: i) The contribution of the annihilation radiation due to positrons emitted in the evaporation process. ii) The high-latitude, Galactic contribution to the measured isotropic flux. We study the dependence of the bounds from the datasets used, the positron annihilation conditions, and the inclusion of the astrophysical background. We derive competitive bounds excluding non-spinning PBH with monochromatic mass function as the totality of dark matter for masses below about 1.6$\times 10^{17}\,$g. We also show that the inclusion of spin and/or an extended, log-normal mass function lead to tighter bounds. Our study suggests that the isotropic flux is an extremely promising target for future missions in improving the sensitivity to PBHs as candidates for dark matter.},

To derive in what phase of the interstellar medium positrons annihilate, we have fitted annihilation models calculated for each phase to the data. We have found that 49% of the annihilation emission comes from the warm neutral phase and 51% from the warm ionized phase. While we may not exclude that less than{\textasciitilde}23% of the emission might come from cold gas, we have constrained the fraction of annihilation emission from molecular clouds and hot gas to be less than{\textasciitilde}8% and{\textasciitilde}0.5%, respectively.  
We have compared our knowledge of the interstellar medium in the bulge (size, density, and filling factor of each phase) and the propagation of positrons with our results and found that they are in good agreement if the sources are diffusively distributed and if the initial kinetic energy of positrons is lower than a few MeV. Despite its large filling factor, the lack of annihilation emission from the hot gas is due to its low density, which allows positrons to escape this phase.},

abstract = {While the beginning of X-ray astronomy was motivated by solar system studies (Sun and Moon), the main research interest soon shifted outwards to much more distant and exotic objects. However, the ROSAT discovery of X-rays from comets in 1996 and the insight that this `new' kind of X-ray emission, charge exchange, was underestimated for a long time, has demonstrated that solar system studies are still important for X-ray astrophysics in general. While comets provide the best case for studying the physics of charge exchange, the X-ray signatures of this process have now also been detected at Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, thanks to Chandra and XMM-Newton. An analysis of the X-ray data of solar system objects, however, is challenging in many respects. This is particularly true for comets, which appear as moving, extended X-ray sources, emitting a line-rich spectrum at low energies. Especially for XMM-Newton, which has the unparalleled capability to observe with five highly sensitive X-ray instruments plus an optical monitor simultaneously, it is a long way towards photometrically and spectroscopically calibrated results, which are consistent between all its instruments. I will show this in my talk, where I will also summarize the current state of solar system X-ray research.},

abstract = {Astronomers commonly use type-Ia supernovae as standard distance measurement tools, though the physics of these bright sources are not fully understood. One product of the thermonuclear explosion is 56Ni, which probably lies at the heart of the supernova cloud. Diehl et al. detected the gamma-ray emission from 56Ni in SN2014J much earlier than expected, only about 20 days after the initial explosion. This early exposure suggests both an asymmetric event and the production of 56Ni farther out in the ejecta than predicted. These sources will help astronomers measure distances far beyond where supernovae have been studied. Science , this issue p. [1162][1] Type Ia supernovae result from binary systems that include a carbon-oxygen white dwarf, and these thermonuclear explosions typically produce 0.5 solar mass of radioactive 56Ni. The 56Ni is commonly believed to be buried deeply in the expanding supernova cloud. In SN2014J, we detected the lines at 158 and 812 kiloelectron volts from 56Ni decay (time {\textasciitilde}8.8 days) earlier than the expected several-week time scale, only {\textasciitilde}20 days after the explosion and with flux levels corresponding to roughly 10% of the total expected amount of 56Ni. Some mechanism must break the spherical symmetry of the supernova and at the same time create a major amount of 56Ni at the outskirts. A plausible explanation is that a belt of helium from the companion star is accreted by the white dwarf, where this material explodes and then triggers the supernova event.

abstract = {We report the detection of the 44Sc nuclear decay lines at 67.9 and 78.4 keV associated with the nuclear decay of 44Ti in Cassiopeia A. The line emission was observed by the Phoswich Detection System instrument on board BeppoSAX, which recently observed the supernova remnant for over 500 ks. The detection of the line emission with a flux of (2.1+/-0.7){\texttimes}10-5 photons cm-2 s-1 in each line (90% confidence) is at the 5 $\sigma$ significance level, if we can assume that the 12-300 keV continuum is adequately represented by a single power law. However, as the nature of the continuum is not clear, we investigate various other possibilities. A more conservative estimate of the line flux is made by assuming that a power-law continuum is at least a good approximation to the continuum emission for a narrower 30-100 keV energy range. With this limitation, the measured line flux is (1.9+/-0.9){\texttimes}10-5 photons cm-2 s-1, with the detection still at the 3.4 $\sigma$ significance level. We suggest that together with the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory/COMPTEL measurement of the 44Ca line at 1157 keV of (3.3+/-0.6){\texttimes}10-5 photons cm-2 s-1, a flux for all three lines of (2.5+/-1.0){\texttimes}10-5 photons cm-2 s-1 for Cas A can be adopted. This implies an initial 44Ti mass of (0.8-2.5){\texttimes}10-4 Msolar.},

abstract = {I describe a new time-domain algorithm for detecting localized structures (bursts), revealing pulse shapes, and generally characterizing intensity variations. The input is raw counting data, in any of three forms: time-tagged photon events (TTE), binned counts, or time-to-spill (TTS) data. The output is the most probable segmentation of the observation into time intervals during which the photon arrival rate is perceptibly constant, i.e., has no statistically significant variations. The idea is not that the source is deemed to have this discontinuous, piecewise constant form, rather that such an approximate and generic model is often useful. Since the analysis is based on Bayesian statistics, I call the resulting structures Bayesian blocks. Unlike most, this method does not stipulate time bins--instead the data determine a piecewise constant representation. Therefore the analysis procedure itself does not impose a lower limit to the timescale on which variability can be detected. Locations, amplitudes, and rise and decay times of pulses within a time series can be estimated independent of any pulse-shape model--but only if they do not overlap too much, as deconvolution is not incorporated. The Bayesian blocks method is demonstrated by analyzing pulse structure in BATSE $\gamma$-ray data.2 For information concerning US Government intellectual property issues connected with the technology contained in this paper, contact Jeanne Stevens, Commercial Technology Office, NASA Ames Research Center, Mail Stop, 202A-3, Moffett Field, CA 94035-1000, (650) 604-0065.},

The elements Th, K, Fe, and Mg give useful results; for Ti are significant only for a few high-Ti regions. Errors are given, and the results are checked by other methods. Concentrations are reported for about 60 lunar regions; the ground track has been subdivided in various ways. The borders of the maria seem well-defined chemically, while the distribution of KREEP is broad. This wide distribution requires emplacement of KREEP before the era of mare formation. Its high concentration in western mare soils seems to require major vertical mixing.},

Comparison with Helioseismsic and Magnetic Imager magnetograms and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly images at 1700 {\AA} shows that the X-ray emission was primarily from a long ribbon in the region of positive polarity with little if any emission from the negative polarity ribbon. However, a thermal plasma source density of ∼1012 cm-3 estimated from the RHESSI-derived emission measure and source area showed that this could best be interpreted as a coronal hard X-ray source in which the accelerated electrons with energies less than ∼50 keV were stopped by Coulomb collisions in the corona, thus explaining the lack of the more usual bright X-ray footpoints. Analysis of RHESSI spectra shows greater consistency with a multi-temperature distribution and a low-energy cutoff to the accelerated electron spectrum of 22 keV compared to 12 keV if a single-temperature distribution is assumed. This leads to a change in the lower limit on the total energy in electrons by an order of magnitude, given the steepness of the best-fit electron spectrum with a power-law index of ∼6.},

The origin of this "Galactic Center Excess" (GCE) has been debated with proposed sources prominently including self-annihilating dark matter and a hitherto undetected population of millisecond pulsars (MSPs). We use a binary population synthesis forward model to demonstrate that an MSP population arising from the accretion induced collapse of O-Ne white dwarfs in Galactic bulge binaries can naturally explain the GCE. Synchrotron emission from MSP-launched cosmic ray electrons and positrons seems also to explain the mysterious "haze" of hard-spectrum, non-thermal microwave emission from the inner Galaxy detected in WMAP and Planck data.},

Some of the positrons escape from the outer layers of the ejecta. We show that the population of low-energy positrons produced by NS-NS and NS-BH mergers in the Milky Way can account for the observed 511-keV line from the Galactic center (GC). Moreover, we suggest how positrons and the associated 511-keV emission can be used as tracers of recent mergers. Recent discovery of 511 keV emission from ultra-faint dwarf galaxy Reticulum II, consistent with a rare NS-NS merger event, provides a smoking-gun signature of our proposal.},

Fragmentation and energy losses are computed using realistic distributions for the interstellar gas and radiation fields, and diffusive reacceleration is also incorporated. The models are adjusted to agree with the observed cosmic-ray B/C and 10Be/9Be ratios. Models with diffusion and convection do not account well for the observed energy dependence of B/C, while models with reacceleration reproduce this easily. The height of the halo propagation region is determined using recent 10Be/9Be measurements as >4 kpc for diffusion/convection models and 4-12 kpc for reacceleration models. For convection models, we set an upper limit on the velocity gradient of dV/dz < 7 km s-1 kpc-1. The radial distribution of cosmic-ray sources required is broader than current estimates of the supernova remnant (SNR) distribution for all halo sizes. Full details of the numerical method used to solve the cosmic-ray propagation equation are given.},

abstract = {The giant impact theory is the leading hypothesis for the origin of the Moon. This review focuses on dynamical aspects of an impact-induced lunar formation, in particular those areas that have advanced considerably in the past decade, including (a) late-stage terrestrial accretion, (b) giant impact simulations, (c) protolunar disk evolution and lunar accretion, and (d) the origin of the initial lunar inclination. In all, recent developments now provide a reasonably consistent dynamical account of the origin of the Moon through a late giant impact with Earth, and suggest that the impact-generation of satellites is likely to be a common process in late-stage solid planet formation.},

abstract = {The Fermi-LAT Galactic Centre excess and the 511 keV positron-annihilation signal from the inner Galaxy bear a striking morphological similarity. We propose that both can be explained through a scenario in which millisecond pulsars produce the Galactic Centre excess and their progenitors, low-mass X-ray binaries, the 511 keV signal. As a proof of principle, we study a specific population synthesis scenario from the literature involving so-called ultracompact X-ray binaries. Moreover, for the first time, we quantitatively show that neutron star, rather than black hole, low-mass X-ray binaries can be responsible for the majority of the positrons. In this particular scenario, binary millisecond pulsars can be both the source of the Fermi-LAT $\gamma$-ray excess and the bulge positrons. Future avenues to test this scenario are discussed.},

The ground segment includes the Mission Operations Centre at ESOC, ESA and NASA ground stations, the Science Operations Centre at ESTEC and the Science Data Centre near Geneva. INTEGRAL was launched on 17 October 2002. The observing programme is well underway and sky exposure (until June 2003) reaches {\textasciitilde}1800{\textasciitilde}ks in the Galactic plane. The prospects are excellent for the scientific community to observe the high energy sky using state-of-the-art gamma-ray imaging and spectroscopy.

abstract = {In this paper, we study gamma ray spectra for various scenarios of dark matter annihilation and decay. We focus on processes which generate only high-energy photons or leptons and photons, but no proton-antiproton pairs, to be compatible with PAMELA's data. We investigate photons produced directly from two-body decay chains and photons produced together with charged particles. For the former case we also include the process DM(+DM) -> N phi -> 2N gamma which can arise from specific strongly-coupled dark matter scenarios. For the latter case, photons are either generated by final state radiation from high-energy leptons or are directly generated from contact interactions represented by higher-order (non-renormalizable) operators obtained after integrating out heavy modes. We compare their overall annihilation cross-sections/decay rates taking into account chiral suppression (in the s-wave approximation), dimension of operators and dark matter particle properties. A rough estimate shows that, for a dark matter particle with a mass of O(1 TeV), the hard photon spectra in direct electron-positron-photon final states arising from either scalar boson dark matter annihilation/decay or Majorana fermion dark matter annihilation are dominated by higher-order operators if the scale of the leading operator is lower than O(1000 TeV). Otherwise, all the photon spectra arising in this way are dominated by final state radiation. Among the spectra studied, the higher-order operators spectrum is the hardest while the final state radiation spectrum with an intermediate decay is the softest.},

abstract = {We present a map of 511{\textasciitilde}keV electron-positron annihilation emission, based on data accumulated with the SPI spectrometer aboard ESA's INTEGRAL gamma-ray observatory, that covers approximately {\textasciitilde} of the celestial sphere. Within the exposed sky area, 511{\textasciitilde}keV line emission is significantly detected towards the galactic bulge region and, at a very low level, from the galactic disk. The bulge emission is highly symmetric and is centred on the galactic centre with an extension of{\textasciitilde}{\textasciitilde}{\textasciitilde}(<i>FWHM<i/>). The emission is equally well described by models that represent the stellar bulge or halo populations. The detection significance of the bulge emission is {\textasciitilde}, that of the galactic disk is {\textasciitilde}. The disk morphology is only weakly constrained by the present data, being compatible with both the distribution of young and old stellar populations. The 511{\textasciitilde}keV line flux from the bulge and disk components is {\textasciitilde}ph cm<sup>-2<sup/> s<sup>-1<sup/> and {\textasciitilde}ph cm<sup>-2<sup/> s<sup>-1<sup/> respectively, corresponding to a bulge-to-disk flux ratio in the range{\textasciitilde}. Assuming a positronium fraction of this translates into annihilation rates of {\textasciitilde} s<sup>-1<sup/>and {\textasciitilde}s<sup>-1<sup/>, respectively. The ratio of the bulge luminosity to that of the disk is in the range . We find no evidence for a point-like source in addition to the diffuse emission, down to a typical flux limit of{\textasciitilde}{\textasciitilde}10<sup>-4<sup/>{\textasciitilde}ph cm<sup>-2<sup/> s<sup>-1<sup/>. We also find no evidence for the positive latitude enhancement that has been reported from OSSE measurements; our {\textasciitilde}upper flux limit for this feature is {\textasciitilde}ph cm<sup>-2<sup/> s<sup>-1<sup/>. The disk emission can be attributed to the -decay of the radioactive species <sup>26<sup/> Al and <sup>44<sup/>Ti. The bulge emission arises from a different source which has only a weak or no disk component. We suggest that Type Ia supernovae and/or low-mass X-ray binaries are the prime candidates for the source of the galactic bulge positrons. Light dark matter annihilation could also explain the observed 511{\textasciitilde}keV bulge emission characteristics.},

abstract = {Most of the celestial $\gamma$ rays detected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on board the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope originate from the interstellar medium when energetic cosmic rays interact with interstellar nucleons and photons. Conventional point-source and extended-source studies rely on the modeling of this diffuse emission for accurate characterization. Here, we describe the development of the Galactic Interstellar Emission Model (GIEM), which is the standard adopted by the LAT Collaboration and is publicly available. This model is based on a linear combination of maps for interstellar gas column density in Galactocentric annuli and for the inverse-Compton emission produced in the Galaxy. In the GIEM, we also include large-scale structures like Loop I and the Fermi bubbles. The measured gas emissivity spectra confirm that the cosmic-ray proton density decreases with Galactocentric distance beyond 5 kpc from the Galactic Center. The measurements also suggest a softening of the proton spectrum with Galactocentric distance. We observe that the Fermi bubbles have boundaries with a shape similar to a catenary at latitudes below 20{\textdegree} and we observe an enhanced emission toward their base extending in the north and south Galactic directions and located within ∼4{\textdegree} of the Galactic Center.},

abstract = {The $\gamma$-ray sky >100 MeV is dominated by the diffuse emissions from interactions of cosmic rays with the interstellar gas and radiation fields of the Milky Way. Observations of these diffuse emissions provide a tool to study cosmic-ray origin and propagation, and the interstellar medium. We present measurements from the first 21 months of the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) mission and compare with models of the diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission generated using the GALPROP code. The models are fitted to cosmic-ray data and incorporate astrophysical input for the distribution of cosmic-ray sources, interstellar gas, and radiation fields. To assess uncertainties associated with the astrophysical input, a grid of models is created by varying within observational limits the distribution of cosmic-ray sources, the size of the cosmic-ray confinement volume (halo), and the distribution of interstellar gas. An all-sky maximum-likelihood fit is used to determine the X CO factor, the ratio between integrated CO-line intensity and H2 column density, the fluxes and spectra of the $\gamma$-ray point sources from the first Fermi-LAT catalog, and the intensity and spectrum of the isotropic background including residual cosmic rays that were misclassified as $\gamma$-rays, all of which have some dependency on the assumed diffuse emission model. The models are compared on the basis of their maximum-likelihood ratios as well as spectra, longitude, and latitude profiles. We also provide residual maps for the data following subtraction of the diffuse emission models. The models are consistent with the data at high and intermediate latitudes but underpredict the data in the inner Galaxy for energies above a few GeV. Possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed, including the contribution by undetected point-source populations and spectral variations of cosmic rays throughout the Galaxy. In the outer Galaxy, we find that the data prefer models with a flatter distribution of cosmic-ray sources, a larger cosmic-ray halo, or greater gas density than is usually assumed. Our results in the outer Galaxy are consistent with other Fermi-LAT studies of this region that used different analysis methods than employed in this paper.},

abstract = {The performance of the SPI point-source data analysis system is assessed using a combination of simulations and of observations gathered during the first year of INTEGRAL operations. External error estimates are derived by comparing source positions and fluxes obtained from independent analyses. When the source detection significance provided by the SPIROS imaging reconstruction program increases from {\textasciitilde}10 to {\textasciitilde}100, the errors decrease as the inverse of the detection significance, with values from {\textasciitilde}10 to {\textasciitilde}1 arcmin in positions, and from {\textasciitilde}10 to {\textasciitilde}1 per cent in relative flux. These errors are dominated by Poisson counting noise. Our error estimates are consistent with those provided by the SPIROS program. With higher detection significance, the accuracy is ultimately limited to {\textasciitilde}0.5 arcmin in position and {\textasciitilde}1 per cent in relative flux by other types of errors. In these cases, SPIROS underestimates the true errors as it only takes into account the Poisson counting noise. At the low signal-to-noise ratio end, SPIROS is also too optimistic, and the number of spurious detections is significantly higher than would be expected from statistical noise fluctuations only. The analysis results do not depend significantly on the target off-axis angle, or on the number of pointings considered, provided that this number is larger than {\textasciitilde}15. Realistic source confusion tests are carried out by adding simulated data to the observation of the Crab nebula and pulsar. Reliable flux values can be obtained for sources separated by angles as small as 0.5 deg if their positions are known and kept fixed in the data deconvolution process. However, when SPIROS is searching for best source positions, if two sources are separated by less than {\textasciitilde}2 deg, it may only find a single spurious source located between the real ones (with a flux equal to the sum of the fluxes). Finally, users of the SPIROS program can find a number of important recommendations in the conclusion.},

abstract = {Aims: We seek to obtain a picture of the interstellar magnetic field in the Galactic center region that is as clear and complete as possible. Methods: We review the observational knowledge that has built up over the past 25 years on interstellar magnetic fields within {\textasciitilde}200 pc of the Galactic center. We then critically discuss the various theoretical interpretations and scenarios proposed to explain the existing observations. We also study the possible connections with the general Galactic magnetic field and describe the observational situation in external galaxies. Results: We propose a coherent picture of the magnetic field near the Galactic center, which reconciles some of the seemingly divergent views and which best accounts for the vast body of observations. Our main conclusions are the following. In the diffuse intercloud medium, the large-scale magnetic field is approximately poloidal and its value is generally close to equipartition with cosmic rays ({\textasciitilde}10 $\mu$G), except in localized filaments where the field strength can reach {\textasciitilde}1 mG. In dense interstellar clouds, the magnetic field is approximately horizontal and its value is typically {\textasciitilde}1 mG.},

Early radio observations were consistent with synchrotron emission, and early X-ray observations revealed the presence of high-energy (>1 keV) photons. These indicated that strong shocks were present during the first ∼2 weeks of the nova's evolution. The radio spectral energy distribution was consistent with thermal emission from week 2 to week 6. Starting in week 7, the radio emission again showed evidence of synchrotron emission, and there was an increase in X-ray emission, indicating a second shock event. The optical spectra show evidence of at least two separate outflows, with the faster outflow possibly having a bipolar morphology. The optical and near-infrared light curves and the X-ray {N}{{H}} measurements indicated that the companion star is likely a K giant.},

abstract = {We review the various ways in which binary pulsars, millisecond pulsars and pulsars in globular clusters may have formed. To this end the formation processes of neutron stars in interacting binaries, and the subsequent evolution of such systems are discussed. In section 2 the observed properties of radio pulsars, single as well as in binaries, are briefly reviewed. The peculiar combination of rapid spin and relatively weak magnetic fields of the binary and millisecond pulsars and the high incidence of binaries among millisecond pulsars strongly suggest that many of them (if not all) are old neutron stars that have been ``recycled'' by the accretion of mass and angular momentum from a companion star in a mass-transfer binary. Recycled pulsars are expected to represent a later evolutionary phase of various observed types of binary X-ray sources. In section 3 the observed properties of the various types of binary X-ray sources are summarized, and the evolutionary history of close binary systems leading to the formation of X-ray binaries is reviewed. In view of the relevance for the later evolution of X-ray binaries into binary and millisecond pulsars, we discuss in this section also the effect of various types of accretion (from a stellar wind, and by Roche-lobe overflow) on the spin evolution of accreting magnetized neutron stars. Subsequently the later evolution and final evolutionary products of X-ray binaries are discussed. Massive X-ray binaries may in the end either leave (i) a very close binary pulsar consisting of two neutron stars (with an eccentric orbit) or a neutron star and a massive white dwarf with a circular orbit, or (ii) two runaway pulsars, one newborn and one recycled, or (iii) a single low-velocity recycled pulsar. Low-mass X-ray binaries may either leave relatively wide binaries with circular orbits consisting of a low-mass (0.2-0.4Msolar) white dwarf and a recycled neutron star, or a single recycled neutron star which has ``evaporated'' its companion star, or possibly has merged with it. We also discuss in this section the possible origin of the velocity-magnetic field correlation observed in single radio pulsars. The correlation can be obtained by a combination of close binary evolution and the occurrence of asymmetries in supernova mass ejection or, alternatively, by a combination of close binary evolution and the evaporation of low-mass companions to young pulsars. Section 4 is devoted to the special formation and evolution processes of close neutron star binaries that operate in globular star clusters. The high incidence of pulsars (mostly binary and/or millisecond pulsars) in globular clusters and the origin of the relatively large fraction (>{\textasciitilde} 50%) of single pulsars among them is discussed. From the discussions in section 4 and section 5 it is concluded that so far no clear evidence - nor the need - for the formation of neutron stars (millisecond pulsars) by the accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs in globular clusters has been presented, although this formation mechanism cannot be excluded. For the formation of low-mass X-ray binaries in the galactic disk this mechanism, however, may make a significant contribution. In section 5 the statistical properties of the binary and millisecond pulsars in globular clusters and in the general field are discussed in relation to the evolution of neutron star magnetic fields. The following conclusions are drawn: (i) There is no longer clear evidence that the magnetic fields of isolated neutron stars (radio pulsars) do decay. (ii) Neutron stars that have been recycled by accretion in close binaries do show clear evidence for magnetic field decay. This field decay may be due to either (a) the accretion process itself or (b) the spin evolution of the neutron stars in binaries which has affected the magnetic field carried by the liquid interior of the neutron star. (iii) A sizeable fraction of all observed single radio pulsars (of order several tens of per cent) may have been recycled in (mostly massive) close binaries. The presence of this group in the general pulsar population may have created the impression that the magnetic fields of single neutron stars do decay. In section 6 the findings of earlier sections are summarized and some open problems are listed. On leave from Raman Research Institute, Bangalore, India.},

In this paper, we document a subset of intense magnetic field-aligned beams of energetic electrons moving away from Jupiter at high magnetic latitudes both north and south of the planet. The number fluxes of these beams are often dominated by electrons with energies above about 1 MeV. These very narrow beams can create broad angular responses in the Jupiter Energetic particle Detector Instrument with unique signatures in the detector count rates, probably because of >10 MeV electrons. We use these signatures to identify the most intense beams. These beams occur primarily above the swirl region of the polar cap aurora. This polar region is described as being of low brightness and high absorption and the most magnetically "open" at Jupiter.},

abstract = {Astrophysical sources are now observed by many different instruments at different wavelengths, from radio to high-energy gamma-rays, with an unprecedented quality. Putting all these data together to form a coherent view, however, is a very difficult task. Each instrument has its own data format, software and analysis procedure, which are difficult to combine. It is for example very challenging to perform a broadband fit of the energy spectrum of the source. The Multi-Mission Maximum Likelihood framework (3ML) aims to solve this issue, providing a common framework which allows for a coherent modeling of sources using all the available data, independent of their origin. At the same time, thanks to its architecture based on plug-ins, 3ML uses the existing official software of each instrument for the corresponding data in a way which is transparent to the user. 3ML is based on the likelihood formalism, in which a model summarizing our knowledge about a particular region of the sky is convolved with the instrument response and compared to the corresponding data. The user can choose between a frequentist analysis, and a Bayesian analysis. In the former, parameters of the model are optimized in order to obtain the best match to the data (i.e., the maximum of the likelihood). In the latter, the priors specified by the user are used to build the posterior distribution, which is then sampled with Markov Chain Monte Carlo or Multinest. Our implementation of this idea is very flexible, allowing the study of point sources as well as extended sources with arbitrary spectra. We will review the problem we aim to solve, the 3ML concepts and its innovative potential.},

abstract = {The radioactive isotope 22Na is one of the primary tracer isotopes that may potentially be detectable by gamma-ray spectroscopy. This isotope is predicted to be produced in ONe nova explosions, yet no detection of its 1.275 MeV gamma-ray signature has been reported so far. In particular, 6 years of COMPTEL observations of the galactic bulge, a region that should be particularly rich in nova explosions, have only led to an upper-limit. In this paper we will present the implications of the COMPTEL upper flux limit on the permissible 22Na yield for ONe novae. We base our analysis on extensive Monte-Carlo simulations of galactic 1.275 MeV emission that were constrained by the most recent results of galactic nova rates and distributions. We demonstrate that the non-detection of the 1.275 MeV line from the galactic bulge implies a solid upper 22Na yield limit in agreement with current theoretical nucleosynthesis calculations.},

abstract = {The first observations of Jupiter made by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory revealed a powerful X-ray aurora located in the polar caps. The X-ray emission exhibited a 40-min periodicity. Such 40-min periodicities have previously been seen in energetic particle fluxes and in Jovian radio emission. This paper develops scenarios in which the X-ray emission is produced by energetic heavy ion precipitation, either on open field lines connecting to the solar wind or on closed field lines reaching to the outer magnetosphere. In order to produce enough X-ray power, both scenarios require the existence of field-aligned electric fields located somewhere between the ionosphere and the magnetosphere, most likely at a radial distance of a few Jovian radii. The potential needed for solar wind ions to produce the observed X-rays is about 200 kV and the potential needed for the magnetospheric ions is at least 8 MV. Protons and helium ions are also accelerated by the potential and should produce an intense ultraviolet aurora. Downward electrical current is carried by the precipitating ions and also by upwardly accelerated secondary electrons produced by the primary ion precipitation. The estimated downward Birkeland current is about 1000 MA for the solar wind case and is about 10 MA for the magnetospheric case. For the magnetosphere scenario, this observed current represents part of the ``return'' current portion of the magnetospheric circuit associated with the departure of the mass-loaded magnetospheric plasma from corotation. The auroral X-ray emission maps at least part of this return current in the polar cap, whereas the main oval, produced by electron precipitation, is thought to map the region of upward Birkeland currents. The accelerated secondary electrons could be responsible for the periodic radio emission (i.e., QP-40 bursts).},

abstract = {We consider the production of positrons in microquasars, i.e. X-ray binary systems that exhibit jets frequently, but not continuously. We estimate the production rate of positrons in microquasars, both by simple energy considerations and in the framework of various proposed models. We then evaluate the collective emissivity of the annihilation radiation produced by Galactic microquasars and we find that it might constitute a substantial contribution to the annihilation flux measured by INTEGRAL/SPI. We also discuss the{\textasciitilde}possible spatial distribution of Galactic microquasars, on the basis of the (scarce) available data and the resulting morphology of the flux received on Earth. Finally, we consider nearby {\textquotedblleft}misaligned{\textquotedblright} microquasars, with jets occasionally hitting the atmosphere of the companion star; these would represent interesting point sources, for which we determine the annihilation flux and the corresponding light curve, as well as the line's spectral profile. We discuss the possibility of detection of such point sources by future instruments.},

abstract = {We present Suzaku X-ray observations along two edge regions of the Fermi Bubbles, with eight {\textasciitilde}= 20 ks pointings across the northern part of the North Polar Spur (NPS) surrounding the north bubble and six across the southernmost edge of the south bubble. After removing compact X-ray features, diffuse X-ray emission is clearly detected and is well reproduced by a three-component spectral model consisting of unabsorbed thermal emission (temperature kT {\textasciitilde}= 0.1 keV) from the Local Bubble, absorbed kT {\textasciitilde}= 0.3 keV thermal emission related to the NPS and/or Galactic halo (GH), and a power-law component at a level consistent with the cosmic X-ray background. The emission measure (EM) of the 0.3 keV plasma decreases by {\textasciitilde}= 50% toward the inner regions of the northeast bubble, with no accompanying temperature change. However, such a jump in the EM is not clearly seen in the south bubble data. While it is unclear whether the NPS originates from a nearby supernova remnant or is related to previous activity within or around the Galactic center, our Suzaku observations provide evidence that suggests the latter scenario. In the latter framework, the presence of a large amount of neutral matter absorbing the X-ray emission as well as the existence of the kT {\textasciitilde}= 0.3 keV gas can be naturally interpreted as a weak shock driven by the bubbles' expansion in the surrounding medium, with velocity v exp {\textasciitilde} 300 km s-1 (corresponding to shock Mach number {M} \simeq 1.5), compressing the GH gas to form the NPS feature. We also derived an upper limit for any non-thermal X-ray emission component associated with the bubbles and demonstrate that, in agreement with the aforementioned findings, the non-thermal pressure and energy estimated from a one-zone leptonic model of its broadband spectrum, are in rough equilibrium with that of the surrounding thermal plasma.},

At present, the two most promising explanations are the annihilation of dark matter particles or the presence of a large population of unresolved point sources, most probably millisecond pulsars, at the Galactic Centre. Here, we report an analysis of the excess characteristics using almost eight years of Pass 8 ULTRACLEAN Fermi-LAT data with SkyFACT{\textemdash}a tool that combines image reconstruction with template-fitting techniques. We find that an emission profile that traces stellar mass in the boxy and nuclear bulge is preferred over conventional dark matter profiles. A model including the bulge is favoured over a model with dark matter at 16$\sigma$.},

Juno's Radiation Monitoring Investigation collected particle counts and noise signatures from penetrating high-energy particle impacts in images acquired by the Stellar Reference Unit and Advanced Stellar Compass star trackers, and the Jupiter Infrared Auroral Mapper infrared imager. This coordinated observation campaign sampled radiation at the inner edges of the high-latitude lobes of the synchrotron emission region and more distant environments. Inferred omnidirectional >5 MeV and >10 MeV electron fluxes derived from these measurements provide valuable constraints for models of relativistic electron environments in the inner radiation belts. Several intense bursts of high-energy particle counts were also observed by the Advanced Stellar Compass in polar regions outside the radiation belts.},

In 2016, COSI had a successful flight from New Zealand on a NASA superpressure balloon. Science results from the flight include imaging and spectroscopy of the positron annihilation emission in the Galactic Center, polarization constraints for a gamma-ray burst, and studies of the Crab nebula and accreting black holes. In this presentation, we describe technical and scientific advances for the COSI project, including advances that would be possible with an upgrade to the balloon payload: an Explorer Mission of Opportunity called COSI-X.},

abstract = {The nuclei fraction in cosmic rays (CR) far exceeds the fraction of other CR species, such as antiprotons, electrons, and positrons. Thus the majority of information obtained from CR studies is based on interpretation of isotopic abundances using CR propagation models where the nuclear data and isotopic production cross sections in p- and $\alpha$-induced reactions are the key elements. This paper presents an introduction to the astrophysics of CR and diffuse $\gamma$-rays and discusses some of the puzzles that have emerged recently due to more precise data and improved propagation models. Merging with cosmology and particle physics, astrophysics of CR has become a very dynamic field with a large potential of breakthrough and discoveries in the near future. Exploiting the data collected by the CR experiments to the fullest requires accurate nuclear cross sections.},

abstract = {We calculate the $\gamma$-ray albedo flux from cosmic-ray (CR) interactions with the solid rock and ice in Main Belt asteroids (MBAs), Jovian and Neptunian Trojan asteroids, and Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) using the Moon as a template. We show that the $\gamma$-ray albedo for the Main Belt, Trojans, and Kuiper Belt strongly depends on the small-body size distribution of each system. Based on an analysis of the Energetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) data we infer that the diffuse emission from the MBAs, Trojans, and KBOs has an integrated flux of less than {\textasciitilde}6 {\texttimes} 10-6 cm-2 s-1 (100-500 MeV), which corresponds to {\textasciitilde}12 times the lunar albedo, and may be detectable by the forthcoming Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST). If detected by GLAST, it can provide unique direct information about the number of small bodies in each system that is difficult to assess by any other method. In addition, the KBO albedo flux can be used to probe the spectrum of CR nuclei at close-to-interstellar conditions. The orbits of MBAs, Trojans, and KBOs are distributed near the ecliptic, which passes through the Galactic center and high Galactic latitudes. Therefore, the asteroid $\gamma$-ray albedo has to be taken into account when analyzing weak $\gamma$-ray sources close to the ecliptic, especially near the Galactic center, and signals at high Galactic latitudes, such as the extragalactic $\gamma$-ray emission. The asteroid albedo spectrum also exhibits a 511 keV line due to secondary positrons annihilating in the rock. This may be an important and previously unrecognized celestial foreground for the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) observations of the Galactic 511 keV line emission including the direction of the Galactic center.},

abstract = {The Fermi bubbles are among the most important findings of the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope; however, their origin is still elusive. One of the unique features of the bubbles is that their gamma-ray spectrum, including a high-energy cutoff at ∼110 GeV and the overall shape of the spectrum, is nearly spatially uniform. The high-energy spectral cutoff is suggestive of a leptonic origin due to synchrotron and inverse-Compton cooling of cosmic-ray (CR) electrons; however, even for a leptonic model, it is not obvious why the spectrum should be spatially uniform. In this work, we investigate the bubble formation in the leptonic active galactic nucleus (AGN) jet scenario using a new CRSPEC module in FLASH that allows us to track the evolution of a CR spectrum during the simulations. We show that the high-energy cutoff is caused by fast electron cooling near the Galactic center (GC) when the jets were launched. Afterwards, the dynamical timescale becomes the shortest among all relevant timescales, and therefore the spectrum is essentially advected with only mild cooling losses. This could explain why the bubble spectrum is nearly spatially uniform: the CRs from different parts of the bubbles as seen today all share the same origin near the GC at an early stage of the bubble expansion. We find that the predicted CR spatial and spectral distribution can simultaneously match the normalization, spectral shape, and high-energy cutoff of the observed gamma-ray spectrum and their spatial uniformity, suggesting that past AGN jet activity is a likely mechanism for the formation of the Fermi bubbles.},

abstract = {Stan is a probabilistic programming language for specifying statistical models. A Stan program imperatively defines a log probability function over parameters conditioned on specified data and constants. As of version 2.14.0, Stan provides full Bayesian inference for continuous-variable models through Markov chain Monte Carlo methods such as the No-U-Turn sampler, an adaptive form of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling. Penalized maximum likelihood estimates are calculated using optimization methods such as the limited memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno algorithm. Stan is also a platform for computing log densities and their gradients and Hessians, which can be used in alternative algorithms such as variational Bayes, expectation propagation, and marginal inference using approximate integration. To this end, Stan is set up so that the densities, gradients, and Hessians, along with intermediate quantities of the algorithm such as acceptance probabilities, are easily accessible. Stan can be called from the command line using the cmdstan package, through R using the rstan package, and through Python using the pystan package. All three interfaces support sampling and optimization-based inference with diagnostics and posterior analysis. rstan and pystan also provide access to log probabilities, gradients, Hessians, parameter transforms, and specialized plotting.},

abstract = {Gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiations from a neutron star merger were discovered on 2017 August 17. Multiband observations of the optical transient have identified brightness and spectrum features broadly consistent with theoretical predictions. According to the theoretical model, the optical radiation from a neutron star merger originates from the radioactive decay of unstable nuclides freshly synthesized in the merger ejecta. In about a day the ejecta transits from an optically thick state to an optically thin state owing to its subrelativistic expansion. Hence, we expect that about a day after the merger the gamma-ray photons produced by radioactive decays start to escape from the ejecta and make it bright in the MeV band. In this paper, we study the features of the radioactive gamma-ray emission from a neutron star merger, including the brightness and the spectrum, and discuss the observability of the gamma-ray emission. We find that more than 95% of the radiated gamma-ray energy is carried by photons of 0.2{\textendash}4 MeV, with a spectrum shaped by the nucleosynthesis process and the subrelativistic expansion of the ejecta. Under favorable conditions, a prominent pair annihilation line can be present in the gamma-ray spectrum with the energy flux about 3%{\textendash}5% of the total. For a merger event similar to GW170817, the gamma-ray emission attains a peak luminosity of $\approx$2 {\texttimes} 1041 erg s-1 at $\approx$1.2 days after the merger and fades by a factor of two in about 2 days. Such a source will be detectable by satellite-ETCC if it occurs at a distance ≲12 Mpc.},

abstract = {Context: The majority of stars form in clusters. Therefore a comprehensive view of star formation requires understanding the initial conditions for cluster formation. Aims: The goal of our study is to shed light on the physical properties of infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) and the role they play in the formation of stellar clusters. This article, the first of a series dedicated to the study of IRDCs, describes techniques developed to establish a complete catalogue of Spitzer IRDCs in the Galaxy. Methods: We have analysed Spitzer GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL data to identify a complete sample of IRDCs in the region of Galactic longitude and latitude 10{\textdegree} < |l|< 65{\textdegree} and |b| < 1{\textdegree}. From the 8 $\mu$m observations we have constructed opacity maps and used a newly developed extraction algorithm to identify structures above a column density of NH_2 ⪆ 1 {\texttimes} 1022 cm-2. The 24 $\mu$m data are then used to characterize the star formation activity of each extracted cloud. Results: A total of 11 303 clouds have been extracted. A comparison with the existing MSX based catalogue of IRDCs shows that 80% of these Spitzer dark clouds were previously unknown. The algorithm also extracts {\textasciitilde}20 000 to 50 000 fragments within these clouds, depending on detection threshold used. A first look at the MIPSGAL data indicates that between 20% and 68% of these IRDCs show 24 $\mu$m point-like association. This new database provides an important resource for future studies aiming to understand the initial conditions of star formation in the Galaxy. The complete version of the catalogue (Table 1) is available in electronic form at the CDS via anonymous ftp to cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsweb.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/qcat?J/A+A/505/405},

abstract = {Stars more massive than about 8-10 solar masses evolve differently from their lower-mass counterparts: nuclear energy liberation is possible at higher temperatures and densities, due to gravitational contraction caused by such high masses, until forming an iron core that ends this stellar evolution. The star collapses thereafter, as insufficient pressure support exists when energy release stops due to Fe/Ni possessing the highest nuclear binding per nucleon, and this implosion turns into either a supernova explosion or a compact black hole remnant object. Neutron stars are the likely compact-star remnants after supernova explosions for a certain stellar mass range. In this chapter, we discuss this late-phase evolution of massive stars and their core collapse, including the nuclear reactions and nucleosynthesis products. We also include in this discussion more exotic outcomes, such as magnetic jet supernovae, hypernovae, gamma-ray bursts and neutron star mergers. In all cases we emphasize the viewpoint with respect to the role of radioactivities.},

abstract = {We use the GEANT4 Monte Carlo framework to calculate the $\gamma$-ray albedo of the Moon due to interactions of cosmic-ray (CR) nuclei with moon rock. Our calculation of the albedo spectrum agrees with the EGRET data. We show that the spectrum of $\gamma$-rays from the Moon is very steep with an effective cutoff around 3-4 GeV (600 MeV for the inner part of the Moon disk) and exhibits a narrow pion-decay line at 67.5 MeV, perhaps unique in astrophysics. Apart from other astrophysical sources, the albedo spectrum of the Moon is well understood, including its absolute normalization; this makes it a useful ``standard candle'' for $\gamma$-ray telescopes. The steep albedo spectrum also provides a unique opportunity for energy calibration of $\gamma$-ray telescopes, such as the forthcoming Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST). Since the albedo flux depends on the incident CR spectrum, which changes over the solar cycle, it is possible to monitor the CR spectrum using the albedo $\gamma$-ray flux. Simultaneous measurements of CR proton and helium spectra by the Payload for Antimatter-Matter Exploration and Light-Nuclei Astrophysics (PAMELA), and observations of the albedo $\gamma$-rays by the GLAST Large Area Telescope (LAT), can be used to test the model predictions and will enable the LAT to monitor the CR spectrum near the Earth beyond the lifetime of the PAMELA.},

abstract = {In this paper, we revisit the problem of the determination of the frequency of occurrence of galactic nova outbursts which involve an oxygen-neon (ONe) white dwarf. The improvement with respect to previous work on the subject derives from the fact that we use the results that our evolutionary calculations provide for the final mass and for the chemical profiles of intermediate-to-massive primary components of close binary systems. In particular, the final evolutionary stages, such as the carbon burning phase, have been carefully followed for the whole range of masses of interest. The chemical profiles obtained with our evolutionary code are of interest in determining the chemical composition of the ejecta after being processed through the thermonuclear runaway, although such other factors as the efficiency of the mixing between the accreted material and that of the underlying white dwarf must also be considered. In our calculations of the frequency of occurrence of nova outbursts involving an ONe white dwarf, we also take into account the observational selection effects introduced by the different recurrence times of the outbursts and by the spatial distribution of novae. In spite of the very different evolutionary sequences, we find that approximately 1/3 of the observed nova outbursts should involve an oxygen-neon white dwarf, in agreement with previous theoretical estimates.},

In the first part of this paper, an algorithm is presented which allows the accurate prediction of the background distribution at a specific line energy using measurements at adjacent energy intervals. The second part deals with the different image reconstruction methods which are applied to COMPTEL data, namely the maximum entropy method, the Richardson-Lucy algorithm and Pixon- based image reconstruction. We conclude that after 5 years of experience with COMPTEL, 1.8 MeV gamma-ray line imaging techniques are well established allowing a comprehensive study of cosmic gamma-ray line emission.},

abstract = {Context. Millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are generally believed to be old neutron stars (NSs), formed via type Ib/c core-collapse supernovae (SNe), which have been spun up to high rotation rates via accretion from a companion star in a low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB). In an alternative formation channel, NSs are produced via the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a massive white dwarf (WD) in a close binary. Aims: Here we investigate binary evolution leading to AIC and examine if NSs formed in this way can subsequently be recycled to form MSPs and, if so, how they can observationally be distinguished from pulsars formed via the standard core-collapse SN channel in terms of their masses, spins, orbital periods and space velocities. Methods: Numerical calculations with a detailed stellar evolution code were used for the first time to study the combined pre- and post-AIC evolution of close binaries. We investigated the mass transfer onto a massive WD (treated as a point mass) in 240 systems with three different types of non-degenerate donor stars: main-sequence stars, red giants, and helium stars. When the WD is able to accrete sufficient mass (depending on the mass-transfer rate and the duration of the accretion phase) we assumed it collapses to form a NS and we studied the dynamical effects of this implosion on the binary orbit. Subsequently, we followed the mass-transfer epoch which resumes once the donor star refills its Roche lobe and calculated the continued LMXB evolution until the end. Results: We show that recycled pulsars may form via AIC from all three types of progenitor systems investigated and find that the final properties of the resulting MSPs are, in general, remarkably similar to those of MSPs formed via the standard core-collapse SN channel. However, as a consequence of the fine-tuned mass-transfer rate necessary to make the WD grow in mass, the resultant MSPs created via the AIC channel preferentially form in certain orbital period intervals. In addition, their predicted small space velocities can also be used to identify them observationally. The production time of NSs formed via AIC can exceed 10 Gyr which can therefore explain the existence of relatively young NSs in globular clusters. Our calculations are also applicable to progenitor binaries of SNe Ia under certain conditions.},

abstract = {We have explored the Eu production in the Milky Way by means of a very detailed chemical evolution model. In particular, we have assumed that Eu is formed in merging neutron star (or neutron star-black hole) binaries as well as in Type II supernovae. We have tested the effects of several important parameters influencing the production of Eu during the merging of two neutron stars, such as (i) the time-scale of coalescence, (ii) the Eu yields and (iii) the range of initial masses for the progenitors of the neutron stars. The yields of Eu from Type II supernovae are very uncertain, more than those from coalescing neutron stars, so we have explored several possibilities. We have compared our model results with the observed rate of coalescence of neutron stars, the solar Eu abundance, the [Eu/Fe] versus [Fe/H] relation in the solar vicinity and the [Eu/H] gradient along the Galactic disc. Our main results can be summarized as follows: (i) neutron star mergers can be entirely responsible for the production of Eu in the Galaxy if the coalescence time-scale is no longer than 1 Myr for the bulk of binary systems, the Eu yield is around 3 {\texttimes} 10-7 M⊙ and the mass range of progenitors of neutron stars is 9-50 M⊙; (ii) both Type II supernovae and merging neutron stars can produce the right amount of Eu if the neutron star mergers produce 2 {\texttimes} 10-7 M⊙ per system and Type II supernovae, with progenitors in the range 20-50 M⊙, produce yields of Eu of the order of 10-8-10-9 M⊙; (iii) either models with only neutron stars producing Eu or mixed ones can reproduce the observed Eu abundance gradient along the Galactic disc.},

abstract = {<i>Context. <i/>Orion is the nearest star-forming region to host a significant number of young and massive stars. The energy injected by these OB{\textasciitilde}stars is thought to have created the Eridanus superbubble. Because of its proximity, Orion is a prime target for a detailed investigation of the interaction between massive stars and their environment.<i>Aims. <i/>We study the massive star population of Orion and its feedback in terms of energy and mass, in{\textasciitilde}order to compare the current knowledge of massive stars with kinematic and radioactive tracers in the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM).<i>Methods. <i/>We assembled a census of the most massive stars in Orion, then used stellar isochrones to estimate their masses and ages, and used these results to establish the stellar content of Orion's individual OB{\textasciitilde}associations. From this, our new population synthesis code was utilized to derive the history of the emission of UV{\textasciitilde}radiation and kinetic energy of the material ejected by the massive stars and also to follow the ejection of the long-lived radioactive isotopes{\textasciitilde}<sup>26<sup/>Al and{\textasciitilde}<sup>60<sup/>Fe. To{\textasciitilde}estimate the precision of our method, we compare and contrast three distinct representations of the massive stars. We compared the expected outputs with observations of <sup>26<sup/>Al gamma-ray signal and the extent of the Eridanus cavity.<i>Results. <i/>We find an integrated kinetic energy emitted by the massive stars of 1.8<sub>-0.4<sub/><sup>+1.5<sup/>{\textasciitilde}{\texttimes} 10<sup>52<sup/>{\textasciitilde}erg. This number is consistent with the energy thought to be required to create the Eridanus superbubble. We also find good agreement between our model and the observed <sup>26<sup/>Al{\textasciitilde}signal, estimating a mass of 5.8<sub>-2.5<sub/><sup>+2.7<sup/>{\textasciitilde}{\texttimes} 10<sup>-4<sup/>{\textasciitilde} of{\textasciitilde}<sup>26<sup/>Al in the Orion region.<i>Conclusions. <i/>Our population synthesis approach is demonstrated for the Orion region to reproduce three different kinds of observable outputs from massive stars in a consistent manner: kinetic energy as manifested in ISM excavation, and ionization as manifested in free-free emission, and nucleosynthesis ejecta as manifested in radioactivity gammarays. The good match between our model and the observables does not argue for considerable modifications of mass loss. If{\textasciitilde}clumping effects turn out to be strong, other processes would need to be identified to compensate for their impact on massive-star outputs. Our population synthesis analysis jointly treats kinematic output and the return of radioactive isotopes, which proves a powerful extension of the methodology that constrains feedback from massive stars.},

abstract = {Context. The annihilation of positrons in the Galaxy's interstellar medium produces characteristic gamma-rays with a line at 511 keV. This gamma-ray emission has been observed with the spectrometer SPI on ESA's INTEGRAL observatory, confirming a puzzling morphology with bright emission from an extended bulge-like region, while emission from the disk is faint. Most known or plausible sources of positrons are, however, believed to be distributed throughout the disk of the Milky Way. Aims: We aim to constrain characteristic spectral shapes for different spatial components in the disk and bulge using data with an exposure that has doubled since earlier reports. Methods: We exploit high-resolution gamma-ray spectroscopy with SPI on INTEGRAL based on a new instrumental background method and detailed multi-component sky model fitting. Results: We confirm the detection of the main extended components of characteristic annihilation gamma-ray signatures, altogether at 58$\sigma$ significance in the 511 keV line. The total Galactic 511 keV line intensity amounts to (2.74 {\textpm} 0.25) {\texttimes} 10-3 ph cm-2 s-1 for our assumed model of the spatial distribution. We derive spectra for the bulge and disk, and a central source modelled as point-like and at the position of Sgr A*, and discuss spectral differences. The bulge (56$\sigma$) shows a 511 keV line intensity of (0.96 {\textpm} 0.07) {\texttimes} 10-3 ph cm-2 s-1 together with ortho-positronium continuum equivalent to a positronium fraction of (1.080 {\textpm} 0.029). The two-dimensional Gaussian that represents the disk emission (12$\sigma$) has an extent of 60+10-5 degrees in longitude and a rather large latitudinal extent of 10.5+2.5-1.5 degrees; the line intensity is (1.66 {\textpm} 0.35) {\texttimes} 10-3 ph cm-2 s-1 with a marginal detection of the annihilation continuum and an overall diffuse Galactic continuum of (5.85 {\textpm} 1.05) {\texttimes} 10-5 ph cm-2 s-1 keV-1 at 511 keV. The disk shows no flux asymmetry between positive and negative longitudes, although spectral details differ. The flux ratio between bulge and disk is (0.58 {\textpm} 0.13). The central source (5$\sigma$) has an intensity of (0.80 {\textpm} 0.19) {\texttimes} 10-4 ph cm-2 s-1.},

abstract = {We study the inverse Compton scattering of solar photons by Galactic cosmic-ray electrons. We show that the $\gamma$-ray emission from this process is substantial, with the maximum flux in the direction of the Sun; the angular distribution of the emission is broad. This previously neglected foreground should be taken into account in studies of the diffuse Galactic and extragalactic $\gamma$-ray emission. Furthermore, observations by GLAST can be used to monitor the heliosphere and determine the electron spectrum as a function of position from distances as large as Saturn's orbit to close proximity of the Sun, thus enabling unique studies of solar modulation. This paves the way for the determination of other Galactic cosmic-ray species, primarily protons, near the solar surface, which will lead to accurate predictions of $\gamma$-rays from p-p interactions in the solar atmosphere. These albedo $\gamma$-rays will be observable by GLAST, allowing the study of deep atmospheric layers, magnetic field(s), and cosmic-ray cascade development. The latter is necessary to calculate the neutrino flux from p-p interactions at higher energies (>1 TeV). Although this flux is small, it is a ``guaranteed flux'' in contrast to other astrophysical sources of neutrinos and may be detectable by km3 neutrino telescopes of the near future, such as IceCube. Since the solar core is opaque for very high energy neutrinos, directly studying the mass distribution of the solar core may thus be possible.},

abstract = {The outburst of Nova Sgr 2011 N.2 (=V5588 Sgr) was followed with optical and near-IR photometric and spectroscopic observations for 3.5 yr, beginning shortly before the maximum. V5588 Sgr is located close to Galactic Centre, suffering from E(B - V) = 1.56 ({\textpm}0.1) extinction. The primary maximum was reached at V = 12.37 on UT 2011 April 2.5 ({\textpm}0.2), and the underlying smooth decline was moderately fast with t^V_2 = 38 and t^V_3 = 77 d. On top of an otherwise normal decline, six self-similar, fast evolving and bright secondary maxima (SdM) appeared in succession. Only very few other novae have presented so clear SdM. Both the primary maximum and all SdM occurred at later times with increasing wavelengths, by amounts in agreement with expectations from fireball expansions. The radiative energy released during SdM declined following an exponential pattern, while the breadth of individual SdM and the time interval between them widened. Emission lines remained sharp (FWHM ∼ 1000 km s-1) throughout the whole nova evolution, with the exception of a broad pedestal with a trapezoidal shape ($\Delta$vel = 3600 km s-1 at the top and 4500 km s-1 at the bottom) which was only seen during the advanced decline from SdM maxima and was absent in between SdM. V5588 Sgr at maximum light displayed a typical Fe II-class spectrum which did not evolve into a nebular stage. About 10 d into the decline from primary maximum, a typical high-ionization He/N-class spectrum appeared and remained visible simultaneously with the Fe II-class spectrum, qualifying V5588 Sgr as a rare hybrid nova. While the Fe II-class spectrum faded into oblivion, the He/N-class spectrum developed strong [Fe X] coronal lines.},

abstract = {The region surrounding the center of the Milky Way is both astrophysically rich and complex, and is predicted to contain very high densities of dark matter. Utilizing three years of data from the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope (and the recently available Pass 7 ultraclean event class), we study the morphology and spectrum of the gamma ray emission from this region and find evidence of a spatially extended component which peaks at energies between 300 MeV and 10 GeV. We compare our results to those reported by other groups and find good agreement. The extended emission could potentially originate from either the annihilations of dark matter particles in the inner galaxy, or from the collisions of high-energy protons that are accelerated by the Milky Way{\textquoteright}s supermassive black hole with gas. If interpreted as dark matter annihilation products, the emission spectrum favors dark matter particles with a mass in the range of 7-12 GeV (if annihilating dominantly to leptons) or 25-45 GeV (if annihilating dominantly to hadronic final states). The intensity of the emission corresponds to a dark matter annihilation cross section consistent with that required to generate the observed cosmological abundance in the early Universe ($\sigma$v∼3{\texttimes}10-26cm3/s). We also present conservative limits on the dark matter annihilation cross section which are at least as stringent as those derived from other observations.},

abstract = {Until now, it has been impossible to observationally measure how star cluster scaleheight evolves beyond 1 Gyr as only small samples have been available. Here, we establish a novel method to determine the scaleheight of a cluster sample using modelled distributions and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. This allows us to determine the scaleheight with a 25 per cent accuracy for samples of 38 clusters or more. We apply our method to investigate the temporal evolution of cluster scaleheight, using homogeneously selected sub-samples of Kharchenko et al. (MWSC), Dias et al. (DAML02), WEBDA, and Froebrich et al. (FSR). We identify a linear relationship between scaleheight and log(age/yr) of clusters, considerably different from field stars. The scaleheight increases from about 40 pc at 1 Myr to 75 pc at 1 Gyr, most likely due to internal evolution and external scattering events. After 1 Gyr, there is a marked change of the behaviour, with the scaleheight linearly increasing with log(age/yr) to about 550 pc at 3.5 Gyr. The most likely interpretation is that the surviving clusters are only observable because they have been scattered away from the mid-plane in their past. A detailed understanding of this observational evidence can only be achieved with numerical simulations of the evolution of cluster samples in the Galactic disc. Furthermore, we find a weak trend of an age-independent increase in scaleheight with Galactocentric distance. There are no significant temporal or spatial variations of the cluster distribution zero-point. We determine the Sun's vertical displacement from the Galactic plane as Z⊙ = 18.5 {\textpm} 1.2 pc.},

abstract = {A new study of the diffuse Galactic $\gamma$-ray continuum radiation is presented, using a cosmic-ray propagation model which includes nucleons, antiprotons, electrons, positrons, and synchrotron radiation. Our treatment of the inverse Compton scattering includes the effect of anisotropic scattering in the Galactic interstellar radiation field (ISRF) and a new evaluation of the ISRF itself. Models based on locally measured electron and nucleon spectra and synchrotron constraints are consistent with $\gamma$-ray measurements in the 30-500 MeV range, but outside this range excesses are apparent. A harder nucleon spectrum is considered but fitting to $\gamma$-rays causes it to violate limits from positrons and antiprotons. A harder interstellar electron spectrum allows the $\gamma$-ray spectrum to be fitted above 1 GeV as well, and this can be further improved when combined with a modified nucleon spectrum which still respects the limits imposed by antiprotons and positrons. A large electron/inverse Compton halo is proposed which reproduces well the high-latitude variation of $\gamma$-ray emission; this is taken as support for the halo size for nucleons deduced from studies of cosmic-ray composition. Halo sizes in the range 4-10 kpc are favored by both analyses. The halo contribution of Galactic emission to the high-latitude $\gamma$-ray intensity is large, with implications for the study of the diffuse extragalactic component and signatures of dark matter. The constraints provided by the radio synchrotron spectral index do not allow all of the $\gamma$-ray emission at less than 30 MeV to be explained in terms of a steep electron spectrum unless this takes the form of a sharp upturn below 200 MeV. This leads us to prefer a source population as the origin of the excess low-energy $\gamma$-rays, which can then be seen as a continuation of the hard X-ray continuum measured by OSSE, Ginga, and RXTE.},

abstract = {An Earth orbiting detector sensitive to gamma-ray photons will see steplike occultation features in its count rate when a gamma-ray point source crosses the Earth's limb. This is due to the change in atmospheric attenuation of the gamma rays along the line of sight. In an uncollimated detector, these occultation features can be used to locate and monitor astrophysical sources provided their signals can be individually separated from the detector background. We show that the Earth occultation technique applied to the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO) is a viable and flexible all-sky monitor in the low-energy gamma-ray and hard X-ray energy range (20 keV-1 MeV). The method is an alternative to more sophisticated photon imaging devices for astronomy and can serve well as a cost-effective science capability for monitoring the high-energy sky. Here we describe the Earth occultation technique for locating new sources and for measuring source intensity and spectra without the use of complex background models. Examples of transform imaging, step searches, spectra, and light curves are presented. Systematic uncertainties due to source confusion, detector response, and contamination from rapid background fluctuations are discussed and analyzed for their effect on intensity measurements. A sky location-dependent average systematic error is derived as a function of Galactic coordinates. The sensitivity of the technique is derived as a function of incident photon energy and also as a function of angle between the source and the normal to the detector entrance window. Occultations of the Crab Nebula by the Moon are used to calibrate Earth occultation flux measurements independent of possible atmospheric scattering effects.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray line radiation at 511keV is the signature of electron-positron annihilation. Such radiation has been known for 30years to come from the general direction of the Galactic Centre, but the origin of the positrons has remained a mystery. Stellar nucleosynthesis, accreting compact objects, and even the annihilation of exotic dark-matter particles have all been suggested. Here we report a distinct asymmetry in the 511-keV line emission coming from the inner Galactic disk ({\textasciitilde}10-50{\textdegree} from the Galactic Centre). This asymmetry resembles an asymmetry in the distribution of low mass X-ray binaries with strong emission at photon energies >20keV (`hard' LMXBs), indicating that they may be the dominant origin of the positrons. Although it had long been suspected that electron-positron pair plasmas may exist in X-ray binaries, it was not evident that many of the positrons could escape to lose energy and ultimately annihilate with electrons in the interstellar medium and thus lead to the emission of a narrow 511-keV line. For these models, our result implies that up to a few times 1041 positrons escape per second from a typical hard LMXB. Positron production at this level from hard LMXBs in the Galactic bulge would reduce (and possibly eliminate) the need for more exotic explanations, such as those involving dark matter.},

abstract = {The angular resolution of a telescope which detects gamma-rays via the Compton effect is fundamentally limited below a few hundred keV by the fact that the target electrons have an indeterminable momentum inside their atoms which introduces an uncertainty in the recoil energy of the Compton electron and the scattered photon. This additional component in the energy and momentum equation results in a Doppler broadening of the angular resolution compared to the standard Compton equation for a target at rest. The deterioration in resolution is most pronounced for low photon energy, high scatter angle, and high Z of the scatter material. This physical limit to the angular resolution of a Compton telescope is present even if all other parameters (e.g. energy and position) are measured with high accuracy. For different Compton scatter materials such as silicon, germanium and xenon, which are used in current telescope designs, the best possible angular resolution as a function of photon energy and scatter angle is calculated. Averaged over all scatter angles and energies, the Doppler-limited angular resolution of silicon is a factor of {\textasciitilde}1.6 better than that of germanium and a factor of {\textasciitilde}1.9 better than that of xenon. Looking at the Doppler limit of materials from Z=1 to 90 the best angular resolution can be reached for alkaline and alkaline earth metals, the worst for elements with filled p-orbitals (noble gases) and d-orbitals (e.g. Pd and Au). Of all semiconductors which might be used in a next generation Compton telescope, silicon seems to be the best choice.},

abstract = {On 2017 August 17, the gravitational-wave event GW170817 was observed by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, and the gamma-ray burst (GRB) GRB 170817A was observed independently by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor, and the Anti-Coincidence Shield for the Spectrometer for the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory. The probability of the near-simultaneous temporal and spatial observation of GRB 170817A and GW170817 occurring by chance is 5.0{\texttimes} 10-8. We therefore confirm binary neutron star mergers as a progenitor of short GRBs. The association of GW170817 and GRB 170817A provides new insight into fundamental physics and the origin of short GRBs. We use the observed time delay of (+1.74+/- 0.05) s between GRB 170817A and GW170817 to: (I) constrain the difference between the speed of gravity and the speed of light to be between -3{\texttimes} 10-15 and +7{\texttimes} 10-16 times the speed of light, (II) place new bounds on the violation of Lorentz invariance, (III) present a new test of the equivalence principle by constraining the Shapiro delay between gravitational and electromagnetic radiation. We also use the time delay to constrain the size and bulk Lorentz factor of the region emitting the gamma-rays. GRB 170817A is the closest short GRB with a known distance, but is between 2 and 6 orders of magnitude less energetic than other bursts with measured redshift. A new generation of gamma-ray detectors, and subthreshold searches in existing detectors, will be essential to detect similar short bursts at greater distances. Finally, we predict a joint detection rate for the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor and the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors of 0.1-1.4 per year during the 2018-2019 observing run and 0.3-1.7 per year at design sensitivity.},

abstract = {Author(s): Kierans, Carolyn | Advisor(s): Boggs, Steven E | Abstract: The signature of positron annihilation, namely the 511{\textasciitilde}keV $\gamma$-ray line, was first detected coming from the direction of the Galactic center in the 1970's, but the source of Galactic positrons still remains a puzzle. The measured flux of the annihilation corresponds to an intense steady source of positron production, with an annihilation rate of 1043{\textasciitilde}e^+/s. Spatially, the 511{\textasciitilde}keV intensity is strongest in the Galactic center region, with an additional component that is consistent with the Galactic disk; however, the unique morphology is not well constrained.The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a balloon-borne soft $\gamma$-ray (0.2--5{\textasciitilde}MeV) telescope designed to perform wide-field imaging and high-resolution spectroscopy, with a goal of furthering our understanding of Galactic positrons. COSI employs a compact Compton telescope design, using 12 cross-strip germanium detectors to track the trajectory of incident photons, where position and energy deposits from Compton interactions allow for a reconstruction of the source sky position and significant background reduction. COSI had a record-breaking 46-day balloon flight from Wanaka, New Zealand, in May--July 2016, and here we report on the detection and analyses of the 511{\textasciitilde}keV emission from those observations. To isolate the Galactic positron annihilation emission, we have developed a background subtraction technique utilizing the COMPTEL Data Space. With this new method, we find a 7.2{\textasciitilde}$\sigma$ detection of the 511{\textasciitilde} line and a broader spatial distribution of the emission than has been previously reported.},

abstract = {Observations of Jupiter carried out by the Chandra Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS-S) instrument over 24-26 February 2003 show that the auroral X-ray spectrum consists of line emission consistent with high-charge states of precipitating ions, and not a continuum as might be expected from bremsstrahlung. The part of the spectrum due to oxygen peaks around 650 eV, which indicates a high fraction of fully stripped oxygen in the precipitating ion flux. A combination of the OVIII emission lines at 653 eV and 774 eV, as well as the OVII emission lines at 561 eV and 666 eV, are evident in the measure auroral spectrum. There is also line emission at lower energies in the spectral region extending from 250 to 350 eV, which could be from sulfur and/or carbon. The Jovian auroral X-ray spectra are significantly different from the X-ray spectra of comets. The charge state distribution of the oxygen ions implied by the measured auroral X-ray spectra strongly suggests that independent of the source of the energetic ions, magnetospheric or solar wind, the ions have undergone additional acceleration. This spectral evidence for ion acceleration is also consistent with the relatively high intensities of the X rays compared with the available phase space density of the (unaccelerated) source populations of solar wind or magnetospheric ions at Jupiter, which are orders of magnitude too small to explain the observed emissions. The Chandra X-ray observations were executed simultaneously with observations at ultraviolet wavelengths by the Hubble Space Telescope and at radio wavelengths by the Ulysses spacecraft. These additional data sets suggest that the source of the X rays is magnetospheric in origin and that the precipitating particles are accelerated by strong field-aligned electric fields, which simultaneously create both the several-MeV energetic ion population and the relativistic electrons observed in situ by Ulysses that are correlated with {\~{ }}40 min quasi-periodic radio outbursts.},

abstract = {The electron-positron annihilation spectrum observed by SPI/INTEGRAL during deep Galactic Centre region exposure is reported. The line energy (510.954+/-0.075 keV) is consistent with the unshifted annihilation line. The width of the annihilation line is 2.37 +/- 0.25 keV (full width at half-maximum), while the strength of the ortho-positronium continuum suggests that the dominant fraction of positrons (94 +/- 6 per cent) form positronium before annihilation. Compared to the previous missions, these deep INTEGRAL observations provide the most stringent constraints on the line energy and width. Under the assumption of an annihilation in a single-phase medium, these spectral parameters can be explained by a warm Te{\textasciitilde} 7000 to 4 {\texttimes} 104 K gas with degree of ionization larger than a few 10-2. One of the widespread phases of the interstellar medium (ISM) - warm (Te{\textasciitilde} 8000 K) and weakly ionized (degree of ionization {\textasciitilde}0.1) - satisfies these criteria. Other single-phase solutions are also formally allowed by the data (e.g. cold, but substantially ionized ISM), but such solutions are believed to be astrophysically unimportant. The observed spectrum can also be explained by annihilation in a multiphase ISM. The fraction of positrons annihilating in a very hot (Te>= 106 K) phase is constrained to be less than {\textasciitilde}8 per cent. Neither a moderately hot (Te>= 105 K) ionized medium nor a very cold (Te<= 103 K) neutral medium can make a dominant contribution to the observed annihilation spectrum. However, a combination of cold/neutral, warm/neutral and warm/ionized phases in comparable proportions could also be consistent with the data.},

If these positrons are injected at even mildly relativistic energies, higher-energy gamma rays will also be produced. We calculate the gamma-ray spectrum due to inflight annihilation and compare it with the observed diffuse Galactic gamma-ray data. Even with a simplified but conservative treatment, we find that the positron injection energies must be 3  MeV, which strongly constrains models for Galactic positron production.},

abstract = {Gravitational waves were discovered with the detection of binary black-hole mergers and they should also be detectable from lower-mass neutron-star mergers. These are predicted to eject material rich in heavy radioactive isotopes that can power an electromagnetic signal. This signal is luminous at optical and infrared wavelengths and is called a kilonova. The gravitational-wave source GW170817 arose from a binary neutron-star merger in the nearby Universe with a relatively well confined sky position and distance estimate. Here we report observations and physical modelling of a rapidly fading electromagnetic transient in the galaxy NGC 4993, which is spatially coincident with GW170817 and with a weak, short $\gamma$-ray burst. The transient has physical parameters that broadly match the theoretical predictions of blue kilonovae from neutron-star mergers. The emitted electromagnetic radiation can be explained with an ejected mass of 0.04 {\textpm} 0.01 solar masses, with an opacity of less than 0.5 square centimetres per gram, at a velocity of 0.2 {\textpm} 0.1 times light speed. The power source is constrained to have a power-law slope of -1.2 {\textpm} 0.3, consistent with radioactive powering from r-process nuclides. (The r-process is a series of neutron capture reactions that synthesise many of the elements heavier than iron.) We identify line features in the spectra that are consistent with light r-process elements (atomic masses of 90-140). As it fades, the transient rapidly becomes red, and a higher-opacity, lanthanide-rich ejecta component may contribute to the emission. This indicates that neutron-star mergers produce gravitational waves and radioactively powered kilonovae, and are a nucleosynthetic source of the r-process elements.},

abstract = {Models have long predicted that the frequency-averaged masses of white dwarfs (WDs) in Galactic classical novae are twice as large as those of field WDs. Only a handful of dynamically well-determined nova WDs masses have been published, leaving the theoretical predictions poorly tested. The recurrence time distributions and mass accretion rate distributions of novae are even more poorly known. To address these deficiencies, we have combined our extensive simulations of nova eruptions with the Strope et al. and Schaefer databases of outburst characteristics of Galactic classical and recurrent novae (RNe) to determine the masses of 92 WDs in novae. We find that the mean mass (frequency-averaged mean mass) of 82 Galactic classical novae is 1.06 (1.13) M ⊙, while the mean mass of 10 RNe is 1.31 M ⊙. These masses, and the observed nova outburst amplitude and decline time distributions allow us to determine the long-term mass accretion rate distribution of classical novae. Remarkably, that value is just 1.3 {\texttimes} 10-10 M ⊙ yr-1, which is an order of magnitude smaller than that of cataclysmic binaries in the decades before and after classical nova eruptions. This predicts that old novae become low-mass transfer rate systems, and hence dwarf novae, for most of the time between nova eruptions. We determine the mass accretion rates of each of the 10 known Galactic recurrent nova, finding them to be in the range of 10-7-10-8 M ⊙ yr-1. We are able to predict the recurrence time distribution of novae and compare it with the predictions of population synthesis models.},

These cosmic rays are shielded by the solar magnetic field for Earth-bound detectors, but not for Voyager 1, which is now beyond the heliopause. We use its data to constrain the fraction of PBHs to the dark matter in the Galaxy, finding that PBHs with M <1016 g cannot contribute more than 0.1% (or less for a log-normal mass distribution). Our limits are based on local Galactic measurements and are thus complementary to those derived from cosmological observations.},

abstract = {We present a new algorithm, called Multiresolution Regularized Expectation Maximization (MREM), for the reconstruction of gamma -ray intensity maps from COMPTEL data. The algorithm is based on the iterative Richardson-Lucy scheme to which we added a wavelet thresholding step in order to eliminate image-noise in the reconstruction. The wavelet thresholding explicitly accounts for spatial correlations in the data, and adapts the angular resolution locally, depending on the significance of the signal in the data. We compare the performance of MREM to that of the maximum entropy and the Richardson-Lucy algorithms by means of Monte-Carlo simulations of COMPTEL 1.809 Me gamma -ray line observations. The simulations demonstrate that the maximum entropy and Richardson-Lucy algorithms provide virtually identical reconstructions which are heavily disturbed by image noise. MREM largely suppresses this noise in the reconstructions, showing only the significant structures that are present in the data. Application of MREM to COMPTEL 1.8 Me gamma -ray line data results in a 1.809 Me sky map that is much smoother than the maximum entropy or Richardson-Lucy reconstructions presented previously. The essential features of this map are (1) an asymmetric galactic ridge emission reaching from l{\textasciitilde}45degr to l{\textasciitilde}240degr , (2) a bright localised emission feature in the Cygnus region around (l,b){\textasciitilde}(80degr ,0degr ), (3) two emission spots at l=317degr and l=332degr situated in the galactic plane, and (4) an extended emission region around (l,b){\textasciitilde}(160degr ,0degr ). Comparison of the MREM map to the simulated reconstructions demonstrates that the 1.809 Me emission is confined to the galactic plane.},

The peak sensitivity of our survey reached an unprecedented level of 4.8 {\texttimes} 10-6 ph cm-2 s-1 (3$\sigma$) that improves the sensitivity of the survey done by Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory/COMPTEL by a factor of {\~{ }}5. As a result, constraining upper limits for all sources from the catalogue of Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs; Green 2014) are derived. These upper limits can be used to estimate the exposure needed to detect 44Ti emission from any known SNR using existing and prospective X- and gamma-ray telescopes. Among the youngest Galactic SNRs, only Cas A shows significant 44Ti emission flux in good agreement with the NuSTAR measurements. We did not detect any other sources of titanium emission in the Galactic plane at significance level higher than 5$\sigma$ confirming previous claims of the rarity of such 44Ti-producing SNRs.},

abstract = {Kepler data from G-, K-, and M-type stars are used to study conditions that lead to superflares with energies above 1034 erg. From the 117,661 stars included, 380 show superflares with a total of 1690 such events. We study whether parameters, like effective temperature or rotation rate, have any effect on the superflare occurrence rate or energy. With increasing effective temperature we observe a decrease in the superflare rate, which is analogous to the previous findings of a decrease in dynamo activity with increasing effective temperature. For slowly rotating stars, we find a quadratic increase of the mean occurrence rate with the rotation rate up to a critical point, after which the rate decreases linearly. Motivated by standard dynamo theory, we study the behavior of the relative starspot coverage, approximated as the relative brightness variation. For faster rotating stars, an increased fraction of stars shows higher spot coverage, which leads to higher superflare rates. A turbulent dynamo is used to study the dependence of the Ohmic dissipation as a proxy of the flare energy on the differential rotation or shear rate. The resulting statistics of the dissipation energy as a function of dynamo number is similar to the observed flare statistics as a function of the inverse Rossby number and shows similarly strong fluctuations. This supports the idea that superflares might well be possible for solar-type G stars.},

abstract = {A new analysis technique was used with HEAO 3 satellite gamma ray data to quantify the galactic 1809 keV emission. A method of bins was applied in summing for specific scan directions, followed by fitting the source and background components. The 1809 keV line of Al-26 was significant because of the recent discovery that Al-26 was overabundant in meteoritic material and implanted during solar system formation. The HEAO 3 flux indicated a current decay of 3 solar masses of Al-26 per year in the interstellar medium, possibly occurring in red giants and massive main sequence stars. The ratio of the observed Al-26 to the Al-27 flux was similar to that measured in meteorites, which suggests that the ratio is normal for the galactic medium and that no supernova triggered the protosolar nebular collapse.},

The first is a relatively quiescent and unremarkable region; the second contains the giant H II region RCW 49, as well as a ``field'' region unrelated to the cluster and nebulosity. Areas near these Galactic longitudes were imaged at J, H, and K bands by 2MASS and at 3-8 $\mu$m by Spitzer for the GLIMPSE Legacy program. We measure the mean values of the color excess ratios (A[$\lambda$]-AK)/(AJ-AK) directly from the color distributions of observed stars. The extinction ratio between two of the filters, e.g., AJ/AK, is required to calculate A[$\lambda$]/AK from those measured ratios. We use the apparent JHK magnitudes of giant stars along our two sight lines and fit the reddening as a function of magnitude (distance) to determine AJ kpc-1, AK kpc-1, and AJ/AK. Our values of A[$\lambda$]/AK show a flattening across the 3-8 $\mu$m wavelength range, roughly consistent with the extinction measurements derived by Lutz and coworkers for the sight line toward the Galactic center.},

Now a $\gamma$-ray survey by ESA's INTEGRAL space telescope has provided data of sufficiently high resolution to settle a long-running debate about where this nucleosynthesis takes place.

Simulations show that the initial mass of 44Ti synthesized in core-collapse supernovae is (0.02-2.5) {\texttimes} 10-4 solar masses (). Hard X-rays and $\gamma$-rays from the decay of this 44Ti have been unambiguously observed from Cassiopeia A only, leading to the suggestion that values of the initial mass of 44Ti near the upper bound of the predictions occur only in exceptional cases. For the remnant of supernova 1987A, an upper limit to the initial mass of 44Ti of <10-3 has been obtained from direct X-ray observations, and an estimate of (1-2) {\texttimes} 10-4 has been made from infrared light curves and ultraviolet spectra by complex and model-dependent computations. Here we report observations of hard X-rays from the remnant of supernova 1987A in the narrow band containing two direct-escape lines of 44Ti at 67.9 and 78.4 keV. The measured line fluxes imply that this decay provided sufficient energy to power the remnant at late times. We estimate that the initial mass of 44Ti was (3.1 +/- 0.8) {\texttimes} 10-4, which is near the upper bound of theoretical predictions.},

abstract = {We have processed the data accumulated with the INTEGRAL SPI instrument over 4 years ({\textasciitilde}51 Ms) to study the morphology of the Galactic "diffuse" emission in the 20 keV to 8 MeV energy range. To achieve this, we simultaneously derived an all-sky census of emitting sources and images of the Galactic ridge (GR) emission. In the central radian, the resolved point-source emission amounts to 88%, 91%, and 68% of the total in the 25-50, 50-100, and 100-300 keV domains, respectively. We compare the spatial distribution of the GR emission with the distributions obtained from CO and near-IR maps and quantify our results through latitude and longitude profiles. Below 50 keV, the SPI data are better traced by the latter, supporting a stellar origin for this emission. Furthermore, we find that the GR emission spectrum follows a power law with a photon index {\textasciitilde}1.55 above 50 keV, while an additional component is required below that energy. This component shows a cutoff around 30 keV, reinforcing a stellar origin, as proposed by Krivonos et al. The component of the diffuse emission due to e{\textpm} annihilations is extracted simultaneously, leading to the determination of the related parameters (positronium flux and fraction). Specific discussion is devoted to the annihilation-line distribution, since significant emission is detected over a region as large as {\textasciitilde}80{\textdegree} {\texttimes} {\textasciitilde}10{\textdegree}, potentially associated with the disk or halo surrounding the central regions of our Galaxy.

abstract = {We present a study of the compatibility of some current models of the diffuse Galactic continuum $\gamma$-rays with EGRET data. A set of regions sampling the whole sky is chosen to provide a comprehensive range of tests. The range of EGRET data used is extended to 100 GeV. The models are computed with our GALPROP cosmic-ray propagation and $\gamma$-ray production code. We confirm that the ``conventional model'' based on the locally observed electron and nucleon spectra is inadequate, for all sky regions. A conventional model plus hard sources in the inner Galaxy is also inadequate, since this cannot explain the GeV excess away from the Galactic plane. Models with a hard electron injection spectrum are inconsistent with the local spectrum even considering the expected fluctuations; they are also inconsistent with the EGRET data above 10 GeV. We present a new model that fits the spectrum in all sky regions adequately. Secondary antiproton data were used to fix the Galactic average proton spectrum, while the electron spectrum is adjusted using the spectrum of diffuse emission itself. The derived electron and proton spectra are compatible with those measured locally considering fluctuations due to energy losses, propagation, or possibly details of Galactic structure. This model requires a much less dramatic variation in the electron spectrum than models with a hard electron injection spectrum, and moreover it fits the $\gamma$-ray spectrum better and to the highest EGRET energies. It gives a good representation of the latitude distribution of the $\gamma$-ray emission from the plane to the poles, and of the longitude distribution. We show that secondary positrons and electrons make an essential contribution to Galactic diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission.},

This analysis revealed that tracers of the old stellar population or the local interstellar medium provide only a poor description of the data. Tracers of the young stellar population considerably improve the fit. Residuals are minimized for the free-free emission map obtained by the DMR at microwave wavelengths and the 158 um fine-structure line map of C+ observed by FIRAS. Within the statistics of the present data, both maps provide an overall satisfactory fit. We therefore conclude that adequate tracers of 26Al sources have now been identified. Implications for 26Al source types are discussed (see also Knodlseder, these proceedings).},

A planetesimal plowing into the young Earth neatly explains the dynamics of today's Earth-moon system, but not its geochemistry. CREDIT: FAHAD SULEHRIA/WWW.NOVACELESTIA.COM LONDON {\textemdash}Among many other contributions to science, the Apollo space program gave geophysicists a grand unified theory of the origin of the moon. The story goes like this: A few tens of millions of years after the birth of the solar system, a now-vanished planet roughly the size of Mars struck Earth a glancing blow that shattered them both and sprayed nearby space with debris. Earth reformed itself; the debris settled into a disk around Earth, which accreted into the moon. The giant impact scenario, based in large part on careful study of the 382 kilograms of moon rocks astronauts brought back between 1969 and 1972, was a triumph of planetary science. But the truth may not be that simple. Over the past decade, increasingly sophisticated computer simulations have shown that the tidy scenario clashes with what geochemists have discovered about moon rocks and meteorites from elsewhere in the solar system. As a result, researchers are casting around for new explanations. At a meeting[*][2] at the Royal Society in London last month{\textemdash}the first devoted to moon formation in 15 years{\textemdash}experts reviewed the evidence. They ended the meeting in an even deeper impasse than before, as several proposed solutions to the moon puzzle were found wanting. So near and{\textemdash}compared with other solar system bodies{\textemdash}so well-known, the moon is not yielding its secrets easily. "It's got people thinking about the direction we need to go to find a story that makes sense," says coorganizer David Stevenson of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. He and others already see one place that might hold a clue: Earth's superheated twin, Venus. ![Figure][1]</img> All mixed up. The standard giant impact ( top ) has trouble explaining chemical similarities between Earth and the moon. Two models published last year do a better job but leave the system with too much angular momentum. ILLUSTRATION: G. GRULL{\'O}N/ SCIENCE Before Apollo, planetary scientists had put forward various theories of the moon's formation{\textemdash}for example, that it took shape alongside Earth from the same accretion disk of dust and rubble; that it was a wanderer captured by Earth's gravity; or that the proto-Earth was spinning so rapidly that it flung into space a blob of material, which condensed into the moon. But each scenario turned out to have some inescapable flaw. Some could not explain the moon's age, as determined from the Apollo rocks: just slightly younger than Earth's. Others could not account for the angular momentum bound up in its orbital dance with Earth. An alternative was waiting: the giant impact hypothesis, first proposed by William Hartmann and Donald Davis in 1975. The scenario appeared outlandish at first, but the closer researchers looked, the more plausible it seemed. The early solar system swarmed with planetesimals that could have struck Earth. A moderate-speed collision with an impactor about a tenth as massive as Earth would have spewed enough material into space to make the moon while leaving the angular momentum of the new system close to what astrophysicists measure today. The clincher was the fact that the giant impact scenario also explained three key findings from Apollo: the moon's age, the evidence that it was very hot in its youth, and its chemical similarity to Earth. "It works. You can make a moon," Stevenson told last month's meeting. Scientists embraced the model at a seminal meeting in Kona, Hawaii, in 1984, and, said Jay Melosh of Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana, "it worked brilliantly for a decade or two." ![Figure][1]</img> Planetary puzzle. The key to Earth's kinship with the moon might lie in rocks from a more-distant world, Venus. CREDIT: NASA Then things started to get complicated. About the same time as the Apollo moon rocks arrived, researchers began studying the ratios of different chemical isotopes in meteorites. The relative abundances of oxygen-16, -17, and -18, in particular, varied so much between meteorites traced to different parts of the solar system that scientists started using the ratios as a marker for the rocks' origin. The moon rocks, however, showed ratios markedly similar to those of rocks from Earth. "The moon and Earth are indistinguishable on the oxygen isotope plot," Melosh said. The isotopes of other elements told the same story. That didn't trouble geophysicists unduly at first, because they assumed that during the giant impact material from Earth and impactor would be thoroughly mixed. Doubts began to arise in 1986, after a team at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico published the first computer simulation of the hypothesized collision. The model was crude{\textemdash}it simulated the Earth-moon system with just 3000 particles{\textemdash}but the results were decisive. They clearly showed that after an impact big enough to produce a moon without leaving the Earth-moon system with excessive spin, the moon would consist almost exclusively of material from the impactor. More recent simulations tell the same story. A 120,000-particle model run in 2004 by Robin Canup of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, suggested that the standard giant impact would leave the moon with more than 80% impactor material. This uneven mixing could explain the isotope results only if proto-Earth and the impactor were made of very similar material to start with{\textemdash}a sign, researchers concluded, that they must have formed close together under similar conditions. That idea received a blow in 2007 from a paper by Stevenson and his then-colleague Kaveh Pahlevan, which modeled how both the impactor and Earth took shape from the disk of debris surrounding the young sun. They argued that a planetesimal like the impactor, with mass a fraction of Earth's, would form out of material from a relatively narrow band around its orbit. A planet the size of Earth, however, would scavenge material from a much wider swathe of the disk, extending past the orbits of Mars and Mercury, where the planet-forming material had very different isotope ratios. So even if the proto-Earth and the impactor formed in similar orbits, their compositions would be different enough to produce distinct isotope ratios in the postcollision Earth and moon. Stevenson and Pahlevan's unexpected result threw origin-of-the-moon research into disarray, forcing planetary scientists to confront two unpleasant possibilities: either the collision between impactor and proto-Earth was more complicated than they have assumed, or their understanding of the makeup of the solar system needs a major overhaul. "The giant impact has major problems. It doesn't produce the moon as seen," Stevenson told the meeting. Theorists soon began tinkering with collision scenarios to come up with one that leaves the ingredients of the proto-Earth and its impactor thoroughly mixed. Stevenson and Pahlevan suggested one such scenario in their 2007 paper. They point out that the heat generated by the giant impact would produce an Earth and a debris disk made of molten and vaporized magma. They calculate that this superheated, churning inferno would take between 100 and 1000 years to cool. During that time, they argue, enough turbulent mixing and diffusion could take place between disk and Earth for them to reach an equilibrium, resulting in a homogeneous Earth and moon. At the meeting, however, some cast doubt on such a scenario. Melosh argued that to reach a uniform composition, Earth and the disk would have to exchange so much material that the disk would collapse. Stevenson admits that this mixing process "can help, but it's not an explanation in itself." Canup says it is important to study the scenario more thoroughly, "but it's a very challenging process to model." More radically, some want to rethink the whole giant impact scenario. Last year, Matija {\'{C}}uk and Sarah Stewart of Harvard University proposed that the impactor was far smaller than thought{\textemdash}only about 1/200 as massive as Earth{\textemdash}that it was moving much faster, and that the proto-Earth was already spinning rapidly ( Science , 23 November 2012, p. [1047][3]). The model can produce a moon of the correct size made up almost exclusively of material blasted from Earth's mantle. Unfortunately, the Earth-moon system winds up with twice as much angular momentum as it has today, but {\'{C}}uk and Stewart also proposed a mechanism for shedding the excess. Soon after the moon forms and as the Earth-moon system is evolving toward its current state, the moon's perigee{\textemdash}the point at which its orbit brings it closest to Earth{\textemdash}moves around Earth in a cyclic motion called precession. The cycles get longer and longer until the rate of precession slows to once per year. Then the precession becomes locked in a fixed position relative to the sun{\textemdash}a rhythm known as evection resonance. As a side effect, the resonance transfers angular momentum from the moon to the sun, in effect spinning up the sun while slowing down the moon. Evection has long been known, but most researchers thought the moon would not stay in the resonance for long. {\'{C}}uk and Stewart say that in their particular scenario, it could last long enough for the moon to shed half its angular momentum. In another paper published simultaneously with {\'{C}}uk and Stewart's ( Science , 23 November 2012, p. [1052][4]), Canup modified the impact scenario in the opposite way. She showed that a high-speed head-on collision between two bodies with similar masses also could have yielded a homogeneous Earth and moon{\textemdash}again at the cost of leaving the system with too much angular momentum. "Now we can produce a disk with the correct composition, but it still requires [evection] resonance to slow it down," Canup says. Evection may prove the Achilles' heel of both scenarios. At the meeting, Jack Wisdom of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge described unpublished results suggesting that {\'{C}}uk and Stewart had overestimated its effects. When the moon is in the evection resonance, he said, its orbit becomes more elongated, and the change produces extreme tidal forces that heat up the moon. This heating, Wisdom says, would change the moon's physical characteristics enough to end the resonance before it had time to drain enough angular momentum from the system. Details aside, many researchers at the meeting bemoaned the fact that things are getting so complicated. In the old impact model, a single simple event was all it took to create the moon. Now the models require an impact followed by some other process{\textemdash}turbulent mixing or evection{\textemdash}to make it work. "We don't have a single scenario which stands out because of its simplicity," Canup said. Melosh agreed. "The solutions are contrived; they're not natural," he said. "We want a solution where isotopic similarity is a natural consequence of the model." There is a way out of the dilemma, but it will not be easy to test. The isotopic similarity between Earth and moon would arise naturally in any of the collisions if researchers are wrong in their assumption that isotope ratios vary markedly across the solar system. This assumption stems from meteorites collected on Earth that have been identified as coming from a few other bodies: a couple of asteroids, a comet, and Mars. For example, researchers have some 120 fragments that were blasted off the martian surface by asteroid or comet impacts. Those rocks show very different oxygen isotope ratios from Earth or moon rocks. But Mars itself is something of an enigma. According to planetary formation models, such a small planet{\textemdash}just 10% as massive as Earth{\textemdash}should not have formed where Mars now sits. So what if Mars actually formed somewhere entirely different and later moved? That would destroy the idea that isotope ratios in the inner solar system change progressively with distance from the sun. With that constraint removed, it would be much easier for scientists to explain how proto-Earth and its impactor could have wound up with similar compositions. That explains why at the London meeting, when the session chairs jokily asked each speaker what single measurement they would most like to perform, many said they would like to examine a piece of rock from the planet Venus. Venus is Earth's rogue twin, and together the two planets contain 80% of the mass between the asteroid belt and the sun. If it turns out that Venus has very similar isotope ratios to Earth, then it is much more likely that an impactor might have had them as well. "Venus is the key," Stevenson said. But how to get hold of a piece of rock from Venus? Venus's surface is often described as "hellish," with atmospheric pressures 92 times those at Earth's surface and temperatures approaching 500{\textdegree}C. Only a handful of probes have survived to reach the surface, and there are no firm plans to return there in the near future. That leaves rocks that fall from the sky: meteorites. Venus's strong gravity makes it much less likely than Mars to have chunks of its rock lofted into space and onto a trajectory toward Earth, but it's not impossible. "We could have a piece in our collections," Canup says. "But how do we know?"

abstract = {Eruptions of classical novae are possible sources of lithium formation and gamma-ray emission. Nova remnants can also become Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The contribution of novae to these phenomena depends on nova rates, which are not well established for the Galaxy. Here, we directly measure a Galactic bulge nova rate of 13.8 {\textpm} 2.6 {{yr}}-1. This measurement is much more accurate than any previous measurement of this kind thanks to many years{\textquoteright} monitoring of the bulge by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey. Our sample consists of 39 novae eruptions, ∼1/3 of which are OGLE-based discoveries. This long-term monitoring allows us to not only measure the nova rate but also to study in detail the light curves of 39 eruptions and more than 80 post-nova candidates. We measured orbital periods for 9 post-novae and 9 novae, and in 14 cases we procured the first estimates. The OGLE survey is very sensitive to the frequently erupting recurrent novae. We did not find any object similar to M31 2008-12a, which erupts once a year. The lack of detection indicates that there is only a small number of them in the Galactic bulge.},

abstract = {The next generation of Compton telescopes (such as MEGA or NCT) will detect impinging gamma rays by measuring one or more Compton interactions, possibly electron tracks, and a final photo absorption. However, the recovery of the original parameters of the photon, especially its energy and direction, is a challenging task, since the measured data only consists of a set of energy and position measurements and their ordering, i.e. the path of the photon, is unknown. Thus the main tasks of the pattern recognition algorithm are to identify the interaction sequence of the photon (i.e. which hit is the start point) and distinguish the pattern from background signatures, especially incompletely absorbed events. The most promising approach up to now is based on Bayesian statistics: The Compton interactions are parameterized in a multi-dimensional data space, which contains the interaction information of the Compton sequence as well as geometry information of the detector. For each data space cell the probability that the corresponding interaction sequence is one of a correctly ordered, completely absorbed source photon can be determined by Bayesian statistics and detailed simulations. This probability can then be used to distinguish source photons from incompletely absorbed photons. Simulations show that the Bayesian approach can improve the 68% event containment of the ARM distribution by up to 40%, and results in a much better separation between "good" and "bad" events. In addition, sensitivity improvements up to a factor 1.7 can be achieved.},

abstract = {The Crab Nebula is used by many instruments as a calibration source, in particular at high energy, where it is one of the brightest celestial objects. The spectrometer INTEGRAL SPI (20 keV-8 MeV), in operation since 2002 October, offers a large data set dedicated to this source, with regular campaigns planned twice per year. We have analyzed the available data to quantify the source behavior on a long-term scale and examine the stability level on timescales from hours to years. As a result, the source flux variability appears to be contained within less than {\textpm}5% around an ∼20 yr mean value for broad bands covering the 20-400 keV energy domain, above which statistics limits any firm conclusion. In terms of spectral shape, the Band model provides a good description of the observed emission between 20 keV and 2.2 MeV. The averaged spectrum best-fit parameters correspond to a low-energy slope of 1.99 {\textpm} 0.01, a high-energy slope of -2.32 {\textpm} 0.02, and a characteristic energy Ec of 531 {\textpm} 50 keV to describe the curvature joining both power laws. The spectral parameters have then been determined on the revolution timescale (∼1-2 days), and their steadiness confirms the source emission stability. As a complementary result, this study demonstrates that the SPI instrument efficiency remains within 5% of its initial value after 17 yr of operation.},

The high charge state solar wind ions resulting from these collisions are left in highly excited states and emit extreme ultraviolet or soft X-ray photons. This solar wind charge exchange mechanism applied to cometary neutrals has been used to explain the soft X-ray emission observed from comets. A simple model demonstrates that heliospheric X-ray emission can account for about 25%-50% of the observed soft X-ray background intensities. The spatial and temporal variations of heliospheric X-ray emission should reflect variations in the solar wind flux and composition as well as variations in the distribution of interstellar neutrals within the heliosphere.

abstract = {The general theory of relativity predicts that a star passing close to a supermassive black hole should exhibit a relativistic redshift. In this study, we used observations of the Galactic Center star S0-2 to test this prediction. We combined existing spectroscopic and astrometric measurements from 1995{\textendash}2017, which cover S0-2{\textquoteright}s 16-year orbit, with measurements from March to September 2018, which cover three events during S0-2{\textquoteright}s closest approach to the black hole. We detected a combination of special relativistic and gravitational redshift, quantified using the redshift parameter ϒ. Our result, ϒ = 0.88 {\textpm} 0.17, is consistent with general relativity (ϒ = 1) and excludes a Newtonian model (ϒ = 0) with a statistical significance of 5$\sigma$.},

abstract = {Bayesian inference involves two main computational challenges. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the posterior distribution may well be highly multi-modal: a regime in which the convergence to stationarity of traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques becomes incredibly slow. Second, in selecting between a set of competing models the necessary estimation of the Bayesian evidence for each is, by definition, a (possibly high-dimensional) integration over the entire parameter space; again this can be a daunting computational task, although new Monte Carlo (MC) integration algorithms offer solutions of ever increasing efficiency. Nested sampling (NS) is one such contemporary MC strategy targeted at calculation of the Bayesian evidence, but which also enables posterior inference as a by-product, thereby allowing simultaneous parameter estimation and model selection. The widely-used MultiNest algorithm presents a particularly efficient implementation of the NS technique for multi-modal posteriors. In this paper we discuss importance nested sampling (INS), an alternative summation of the MultiNest draws, which can calculate the Bayesian evidence at up to an order of magnitude higher accuracy than `vanilla' NS with no change in the way MultiNest explores the parameter space. This is accomplished by treating as a (pseudo-)importance sample the totality of points collected by MultiNest, including those previously discarded under the constrained likelihood sampling of the NS algorithm. We apply this technique to several challenging test problems and compare the accuracy of Bayesian evidences obtained with INS against those from vanilla NS.},

abstract = {The Milky Way bulge has a boxy/peanut morphology and an X-shaped structure. This X-shape has been revealed by the {\textquotedblleft}split in the red clump{\textquotedblright} from star counts along the line of sight toward the bulge, measured from photometric surveys. This boxy, X-shaped bulge morphology is not unique to the Milky Way and such bulges are observed in other barred spiral galaxies. N-body simulations show that boxy and X-shaped bulges are formed from the disk via dynamical instabilities. It has also been proposed that the Milky Way bulge is not X-shaped, but rather, the apparent split in the red clump stars is a consequence of different stellar populations, in an old classical spheroidal bulge. We present a Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) image of the Milky Way bulge, produced by downsampling the publicly available {\textquotedblleft}unWISE{\textquotedblright} coadds. The WISE image of the Milky Way bulge shows that the X-shaped nature of the Milky Way bulge is self-evident and irrefutable. The X-shape morphology of the bulge in itself and the fraction of bulge stars that comprise orbits within this structure has important implications for the formation history of the Milky Way, and, given the ubiquity of boxy X-shaped bulges, spiral galaxies in general.},

abstract = {The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a balloon-borne $\gamma$-ray (0.2-5 MeV) telescope designed to study astrophysical sources. COSI employs a compact Compton telescope design utilizing 12 high-purity germanium double-sided strip detectors and is inherently sensitive to polarization. In 2016, COSI was launched from Wanaka, New Zealand and completed a successful 46-day flight on NASA's new Super Pressure Balloon. In order to perform imaging, spectral, and polarization analysis of the sources observed during the 2016 flight, we compute the detector response from well-benchmarked simulations. As required for accurate simulations of the instrument, we have built a comprehensive mass model of the instrument and developed a detailed detector effects engine which applies the intrinsic detector performance to Monte Carlo simulations. The simulated detector effects include energy, position, and timing resolution, thresholds, dead strips, charge sharing, charge loss, crosstalk, dead time, and detector trigger conditions. After including these effects, the simulations closely resemble the measurements, the standard analysis pipeline used for measurements can also be applied to the simulations, and the responses computed from the simulations are accurate. We have computed the systematic error that we must apply to measured fluxes at certain energies, which is 6.3% on average. Here we describe the detector effects engine and the benchmarking tests performed with calibrations.},

In particular, the interpretation of the hot (kT $\approx$ 7 keV) component of the GCDX, characterized by the strong Fe 6.7 keV line emission, has been contentious. If the hot component originates from a truly diffuse interstellar plasma, not a collection of unresolved point sources, such plasma cannot be gravitationally bound, and its regeneration would require a huge amount of energy. Here, we show that the spatial distribution of the GCDX does not correlate with the number density distribution of an old stellar population traced by near-infrared light, strongly suggesting a significant contribution of the diffuse interstellar plasma. Contributions of the old stellar population to the GCDX are implied to be {\textasciitilde}50% and {\textasciitilde}20% in the nuclear stellar disk (NSD) and nuclear star cluster, respectively. For the NSD, a scale height of 0.{\textdegree}32 {\textpm} 0.{\textdegree}02 is obtained for the first time from the stellar number density profiles. We also show the results of the extended near-infrared polarimetric observations in the central 3{\textdegree} {\texttimes} 2{\textdegree} region of our Galaxy, and confirm that the GCDX region is permeated by a large scale, toroidal magnetic field (MF) as previously claimed. Together with observed MF strengths close to energy equipartition, the hot plasma could be magnetically confined, reducing the amount of energy required to sustain it.},

abstract = {In the Milky Way galaxy, positrons, which are responsible for the diffuse 511 keV gamma ray emission observed by space-based gamma ray observatories, are thought to annihilate predominantly through charge exchange interactions with neutral hydrogen. These charge exchange interactions can only take place if positrons have energies greater than 6.8 eV, the minimum energy required to liberate the electron bound to the hydrogen atom and then form positronium, a short-lived bound state composed of a positron-electron pair. Here we demonstrate the importance of positron interactions with neutral alkali metals in the warm interstellar medium (ISM). Positrons may undergo charge exchange with these atoms at any energy. In particular, we show that including positron interactions with sodium at solar abundance in the warm ISM can significantly reduce the annihilation timescale of positrons with energies below 6.8 eV by at least an order of magnitude. We show that including these interactions in our understanding of positron annihilation in the Milky Way rules out the idea that the number of positrons in the Galactic ISM could be maintained in steady state by injection events occurring at a typical periodicity >Myr .},

Since the source function is derived from measured fluxes, the proposed method is referred to as a semiempirical model. This model derives a source strength directly from measurements with an omnidirectional counter, thereby being an inverse of previous approaches. Source strengths are determined for 38 predicted atmospheric gamma ray lines and for 10 different energies in the continuum. Total and directional fluxes are calculated at two different atmospheric depths. The results are found to be consistent with other measurements and theoretical calculations.},

abstract = {Context. The Galaxy hosts a widespread population of low-energy positrons revealed by successive generations of gamma-ray telescopes through a bright annihilation emission from the bulge region, with a fainter contribution from the inner disk. The exact origin of these particles remains currently unknown. Aims: We estimate the contribution to the annihilation signal of positrons generated in the decay of radioactive 26Al, 56Ni and 44Ti. Methods: We adapted the GALPROP propagation code to simulate the transport and annihilation of radioactivity positrons in a model of our Galaxy. Using plausible source spatial distributions, we explored several possible propagation scenarios to account for the large uncertainties on the transport of {\textasciitilde}MeV positrons in the interstellar medium. We then compared the predicted intensity distributions to the INTEGRAL/SPI observations. Results: We obtain similar intensity distributions with small bulge-to-disk ratios, even for extreme large-scale transport prescriptions. At least half of the positrons annihilate close to their sources, even when they are allowed to travel far away. In the high-diffusion, ballistic case, up to 40% of them escape the Galaxy. In proportion, this affects bulge positrons more than disk positrons because they are injected further off the plane in a tenuous medium, while disk positrons are mostly injected in the dense molecular ring. The predicted intensity distributions are fully consistent with the observed longitudinally-extended disk-like emission, but the transport scenario cannot be strongly constrained by the current data. Conclusions: Nucleosynthesis positrons alone cannot account for the observed annihilation emission in the frame of our model. An additional component is needed to explain the strong bulge contribution, and the latter is very likely concentrated in the central regions if positrons have initial energies in the 100 keV - 1 MeV range.},

abstract = {We have analyzed data from two sets of calibration observations of the Moon made by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory. In addition to obtaining a spectrum of the bright side that shows several distinct fluorescence lines, we also clearly detect time-variable soft X-ray emission, primarily O VII K$\alpha$ and O VIII Ly$\alpha$, when viewing the optically dark side. The apparent dark-side brightness varied in time by at least an order of magnitude, up to {\textasciitilde}2{\texttimes}10-6 photons s-1 arcmin-2 cm-2 between 500 and 900 eV, which is comparable to the typical 3/4 keV-band background emission measured in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. The spectrum is also very similar to background spectra recorded by Chandra in low- or moderate-brightness regions of the sky. Over a decade ago, ROSAT also detected soft X-rays from the dark side of the Moon, which were tentatively ascribed to continuum emission from energetic solar wind electrons impacting the lunar surface. The Chandra observations, however, with their better spectral resolution, combined with contemporaneous measurements of solar wind parameters, strongly favor charge transfer between highly charged solar wind ions and neutral hydrogen in the Earth's geocorona as the mechanism for this emission. We present a theoretical model of geocoronal emission and show that predicted spectra and intensities match the Chandra observations very well. We also model the closely related process of heliospheric charge transfer and estimate that the total charge transfer flux observed from Earth amounts to a significant fraction of the soft X-ray background, particularly in the ROSAT 3/4 keV band.},

Observations of the isotropic gamma-ray background around 100 MeV place an upper limit of 10,000 per cu pc on the average number density of primordial black holes with initial masses around 10 to the 15th power g. The local number density could be greater than this by a factor of up to 1 million if the black holes were clustered in the halos of galaxies. The best prospect for detecting a primordial black hole seems to be to look for the burst of hard gamma rays that would be expected in the final stages of the evaporation of the black hole. Such observations would be a great confirmation of general relativity and quantum theory and would provide information about the early universe and about strong-interaction physics.},

abstract = {Gamma-rays from nuclear de-excitation of newly procuced isotopes during supernovae (SNe) provide a unique window to the explosion mechanisms. SNe interiors are accessible only by $\gamma$-rays as they are energetic enough to penetrate the SN cloud. Both thermonuclear explosions (type Ia) and core-collapse SNe (CCSN, type II) are key producers of heavy elements in the Universe. In SNe Ia, a white dwarf (WD) is disrupted by ignition from inside or by triggering the explosive event from outside, producing major amounts of 56Ni. Type II SNe are powered by the gravitational collapse of a massive star, having burnt all its nuclear fuel. In this work, we present a diagnostic study of $\gamma$-ray lines from SN2014J and Cassiopeia A (Cas A). INTEGRAL observed SN2014J for several months and for the first time, it was possible to measure the characteristic lines from the 56Ni-decay chain in a SN Ia event. Surprisingly, 56Ni was seen only 20 days after the explosion which indicates that some 56Ni must be located outside the WD and not deeply embedded. We provide a 56Co $\gamma$-ray line light curve and estimate a visible 56Ni mass of 0.5 M{\&}{\#}10752; from a comparison to 1D model light curves. Cas A observations have been revisited and we detect both, the characteristic hard X-ray line from the decay of 44Ti at 78 keV, and the subsequent $\gamma$-ray line from the decay of 44Sc at 1157 keV in one coherent data set. Expansion velocities in the range of 2000 - 5000 km s-1 and an initially synthesised 44Ti mass of 1.37 {\texttimes} 10-4 M{\&}{\#}10752; are found.},

abstract = {The 511 keV positron annihilation emission remains a mysterious component of the high energy emission of our Galaxy. Its study was one of the key scientific objectives of the SPI spectrometer on board the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory satellite. In fact, a lot of observing time has been dedicated to the Galactic disk with a particular emphasis on the central region. A crucial issue in such an analysis concerns the reduction technique used to treat this huge quantity of data, and more particularly the background modeling. Our method, after validation through a variety of tests, is based on detector pattern determination per {\textasciitilde}6 month period, together with a normalization variable on a few hour timescale. The Galactic bulge is detected at a level of {\textasciitilde}70$\sigma$, allowing more detailed investigations. The main result is that the bulge morphology can be modeled with two axisymmetric Gaussians of 3fdg2 and 11fdg8 FWHM and respective fluxes of 2.5 and 5.4 {\texttimes} 10^-4 photons cm^-2 s^-1. We found a possible shift of the bulge center toward negative longitude at l = -0fdg6 {\textpm} 0fdg2. In addition to the bulge, a more extended structure is detected significantly with flux ranging from 1.7 to 2.9 {\texttimes} 10^-3 photons cm^-2 s^-1 depending on its assumed geometry (pure disk or disk plus halo). The disk emission is also found to be symmetric within the limits of the statistical errors. Based on observations with INTEGRAL, an ESA project with instruments and science data center funded by ESA member states (especially the PI countries: Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and Switzerland), the Czech Republic, and Poland, with the participation of Russia and USA.},

abstract = {Recently a gamma-ray excess has been identified in the inner Milky Way, which may be associated with the final state photon shower following DM annihilation to standard model final states. In this scenario {\textasciitilde} GeV electrons are also produced and, given their long energy loss timescale ({\textasciitilde} Gyr), they can diffuse and escape the galaxy before losing too much energy. If such an electron population exists in the IGM, one observable consequence would be inverse Compton scattering on the CMB, which would produce UV photons that can efficiently ionize the IGM. This may be a possible resolution to the "Photon Underproduction Crisis", recently pointed out by Kollmeier et al. (2014). Regardless of the relevance to this crisis, the existence of a {\textasciitilde} GeV electron population in the IGM can put constraints on DM annihilation parameters considering the known X-ray backgrounds.},

abstract = {A study of the instrumental background in balloon-borne gamma-ray spectrometers is presented. The calculations are based on newly available interaction cross sections and new analytic techniques, and are the most detailed and accurate published to date. Results compare well with measurements made in the 20 keV to 10 MeV energy range by the Goddard Low Energy Gamma-ray Spectrometer (LEGS). The principal components of the continuum background in spectrometers with Ge detectors and thick active shields are (1) elastic neutron scattering of atmospheric neutrons on the Ge nuclei, (2) aperture flux of atmospheric and cosmic gamma rays, (3)$\beta$- decays of unstable nuclides produced by nuclear interactions of atmospheric protons and neutrons with Ge nuclei, and (4) shield leakage of atmospheric gamma rays. The improved understanding of these components leads to several recommended techniques for reducing the background. These include minimizing the passive material inside the shield and reducing the level of the shield threshold. A new type of coaxial n-type Ge detector with its outer contact segmented into horizontal rings can be used in various modes to reduce background in the 20 keV to 1 MeV energy range. The resulting improvement in instrument sensitivity to spectral lines is a factor of {\textasciitilde} 2 in this energy range.},

abstract = {COMPTEL observations of the Orion/Monoceros region have shown distinct evidence for excessive 3-7 MeV emission that was attributed to nuclear de-excitation lines from accelerated 12C and 16O nuclei. Unfortunately, we must conclude now that this appears to be a spurious result. This conclusion follows from a better understanding of the instrumental background, from a better exposure of the region, and from an improved analysis method. We show here how the impact of each of these gradually reduces the signal to a less than 3 $\sigma$ result. The prime underlying cause seems to be 24Na activation in and around the upper COMPTEL detectors. Combining all available data, we now set a 2 $\sigma$ flux upper limit on the 3-7 MeV emission of Orion of 3{\texttimes}10-5 $\gamma$ cm-2 s-1, to be compared with the previously derived flux of {\textasciitilde}10-4 $\gamma$ cm-2 s-1.},

Analysis of the spectra reveals a well-resolved electron-positron annihilation line at 511 keV and the associated continuum due to annihilation via positronium formation.

abstract = {New light states thermally coupled to the Standard Model plasma alter the expansion history of the Universe and impact the synthesis of the primordial light elements. In this work, we carry out an exhaustive and precise analysis of the implications of MeV-scale BSM particles in Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations. We find that BBN observations set a lower bound on the thermal dark matter mass of m$\chi$ > 0.4 MeV at 2$\sigma$. This bound is independent of the spin and number of internal degrees of freedom of the particle, of the annihilation being s-wave or p-wave, and of the annihilation final state. Furthermore, we show that current BBN plus CMB observations constrain purely electrophilic and neutrinophilic BSM species to have a mass, m$\chi$ > 3.7 MeV at 2$\sigma$. We explore the reach of future BBN measurements and show that upcoming CMB missions should improve the bounds on light BSM thermal states to m$\chi$ > (10-15) MeV. Finally, we demonstrate that very light BSM species thermally coupled to the SM plasma are highly disfavoured by current cosmological observations.},

We find that all such profiles have the same shape, independent of the halo mass, the initial density fluctuation spectrum, and the values of the cosmological parameters. Spherically averaged equilibrium profiles are well fitted over two decades in radius by a simple formula originally proposed to describe the structure of galaxy clusters in a cold dark matter universe. In any particular cosmology, the two scale parameters of the fit, the halo mass and its characteristic density, are strongly correlated. Low-mass halos are significantly denser than more massive systems, a correlation that reflects the higher collapse redshift of small halos. The characteristic density of an equilibrium halo is proportional to the density of the universe at the time it was assembled. A suitable definition of this assembly time allows the same proportionality constant to be used for all the cosmologies that we have tested. We compare our results with previous work on halo density profiles and show that there is good agreement. We also provide a step-by-step analytic procedure, based on the Press-Schechter formalism, that allows accurate equilibrium profiles to be calculated as a function of mass in any hierarchical model.},

abstract = {Jupiter has the most energetic and complex radiation belts in our solar system. Their hazardous environment is the reason why so many spacecraft avoid rather than investigate them, and explains how they have kept many of their secrets so well hidden, despite having been studied for decades. In this White Paper we argue why these secrets are worth unveiling. Jupiter's radiation belts and the vast magnetosphere that encloses them constitute an unprecedented physical laboratory, suitable for both interdisciplinary and novel scientific investigations: from studying fundamental high energy plasma physics processes which operate throughout the universe, such as adiabatic charged particle acceleration and nonlinear wave-particle interactions; to exploiting the astrobiological consequences of energetic particle radiation. The in-situ exploration of the uninviting environment of Jupiter's radiation belts present us with many challenges in mission design, science planning, instrumentation and technology development. We address these challenges by reviewing the different options that exist for direct and indirect observation of this unique system. We stress the need for new instruments, the value of synergistic Earth and Jupiter-based remote sensing and in-situ investigations, and the vital importance of multi-spacecraft, in-situ measurements. While simultaneous, multi-point in-situ observations have long become the standard for exploring electromagnetic interactions in the inner solar system, they have never taken place at Jupiter or any strongly magnetized planet besides Earth. We conclude that a dedicated multi-spacecraft mission to Jupiter's radiation belts is an essential and obvious way forward and deserves to be given a high priority in ESA's Voyage 2050 programme.},

abstract = {The most promising astrophysical sources of kHz gravitational waves (GWs) are the inspiral and merger of binary neutron star(NS)/black hole systems. Maximizing the scientific return of a GW detection will require identifying a coincident electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. One of the most likely sources of isotropic EM emission from compact object mergers is a supernova-like transient powered by the radioactive decay of heavy elements synthesized in ejecta from the merger. We present the first calculations of the optical transients from compact object mergers that self-consistently determine the radioactive heating by means of a nuclear reaction network; using this heating rate, we model the light curve with a one-dimensional Monte Carlo radiation transfer calculation. For an ejecta mass {\textasciitilde}10-2Msolar (10-3Msolar) the resulting light-curve peaks on a time-scale {\textasciitilde}1d at a V-band luminosity $\nu$L$\nu$ {\textasciitilde} 3 {\texttimes} 1041 (1041)ergs-1 [MV = -15(-14)] this corresponds to an effective `f' parameter {\textasciitilde}3 {\texttimes} 10-6 in the Li-Paczynski toy model. We argue that these results are relatively insensitive to uncertainties in the relevant nuclear physics and to the precise early-time dynamics and ejecta composition. Since NS merger transients peak at a luminosity that is a factor of {\textasciitilde}103 higher than a typical nova, we propose naming these events `kilo-novae'. Because of the rapid evolution and low luminosity of NS merger transients, EM counterpart searches triggered by GW detections will require close collaboration between the GW and astronomical communities. NS merger transients may also be detectable following a short-duration gamma-ray burst or `blindly' with present or upcoming optical transient surveys. Because the emission produced by NS merger ejecta is powered by the formation of rare r-process elements, current optical transient surveys can directly constrain the unknown origin of the heaviest elements in the Universe.},

abstract = {Bayesian Blocks is a time-domain algorithm for detecting localized structures (bursts), revealing pulse shapes within bursts, and generally characterizing intensity variations. The input is raw time series data, in almost any form. Three data modes are elaborated: (1) time-tagged events, (2) binned counts, and (3) measurements at arbitrary times with normal errors. The output is the most probable segmentation of the observation interval into sub-intervals during which the signal is perceptibly constant, i.e. has no statistically significant variations. The idea is not that the source is deemed to actually have this discontinuous, piecewise constant form, rather that such an approximate and generic model is often useful. Treatment of data gaps, variable exposure, extension to piecewise linear and piecewise exponential representations, multi-variate time series data, analysis of variance, data on the circle, other data modes, and dispersed data are included. This implementation is exact and replaces the greedy, approximate, and outdated algorithm implemented in BLOCK.},

abstract = {By extending our previous study by Maehara et al., we searched for superflares on G-type dwarfs (solar-type stars) using Kepler data for a longer period (500 days) than that (120 days) in our previous study. As a result, we found 1547 superflares on 279 G-type dwarfs, which is much more than the previous 365 superflares on 148 stars. Using these new data, we studied the statistical properties of the occurrence rate of superflares, and confirmed the previous results, i.e., the occurrence rate (dN/dE) of superflares versus flare energy (E) shows a power-law distribution with dN/dEvpropE -$\alpha$, where $\alpha$ {\textasciitilde} 2. It is interesting that this distribution is roughly similar to that for solar flares. In the case of the Sun-like stars (with surface temperature 5600-6000 K and slowly rotating with a period longer than 10 days), the occurrence rate of superflares with an energy of 1034-1035 erg is once in 800-5000 yr. We also studied long-term (500 days) stellar brightness variation of these superflare stars and found that in some G-type dwarfs the occurrence rate of superflares was extremely high, {\textasciitilde}57 superflares in 500 days (i.e., once in 10 days). In the case of Sun-like stars, the most active stars show a frequency of one superflare (with 1034 erg) in 100 days. There is evidence that these superflare stars have extremely large starspots with a size about 10 times larger than that of the largest sunspot. We argue that the physical origin of the extremely high occurrence rate of superflares in these stars may be attributed to the existence of extremely large starspots.},

Primordial black holes of masses ≲1015 kg will evaporate to produce e{\textpm} pairs. The positrons will lose energy in the Galactic Center, become nonrelativistic, then annihilate with the ambient electrons. We derive robust and conservative bounds by assuming that the rate of positron injection via primordial black hole evaporation is less than what is required to explain the SPI/INTEGRAL observation of the Galactic Center 511 keV $\gamma$ -ray line. Depending on the primordial black hole mass function and other astrophysical uncertainties, these constraints are the most stringent in the literature and show that primordial black holes contribute to less than 1% of the dark matter density. Our technique also probes part of the mass range which was completely unconstrained by previous studies.},

abstract = {The microwave "haze" was first discovered with the initial release of the full sky data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP). It is diffuse emission toward the center of our Galaxy with spectral behavior that makes it difficult to categorize as any of the previously known emission mechanisms at those wavelengths. With now seven years of WMAP data publicly available, we have learned much about the nature of the haze, and with the release of data from the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope and the discovery of the gamma-ray haze/bubbles, we have had a spectacular confirmation of its existence at other wavelengths. As the WMAP mission winds down and the Planck mission prepares to release data, I take a last look at what WMAP has to tell us about the origin of this unique Galactic feature. Much like the gamma rays, the microwave haze/bubbles is/are elongated in latitude with respect to longitude by a factor of roughly two, and at high latitudes, the microwave emission cuts off sharply above {\textasciitilde}35{\textdegree} (compared to {\textasciitilde}50{\textdegree} in the gammas). The hard spectrum of electrons required to generate the microwave synchrotron is consistent with that required to generate gamma-ray emission via inverse Compton scattering, though it is likely that these signals result from distinct regions of the spectrum ({\textasciitilde}10 GeV for the microwaves and {\textasciitilde}1 TeV for the gammas). While there is no evidence for significant haze polarization in the seven-year WMAP data, I demonstrate explicitly that it is unlikely such a signal would be detectable above the noise.},

abstract = {The Nuclear Compton Telescope (NCT) is a balloon-borne Compton telescope designed for the study of astrophysical sources in the soft gamma-ray regime (200 keV-20 MeV). NCT's 10 high-purity germanium crossed-strip detectors measure the deposited energies and three-dimensional positions of gamma-ray interactions in the sensitive volume, and this information is used to restrict the initial photon to a circle on the sky using the Compton scatter technique. Thus NCT is able to perform spectroscopy, imaging, and polarization analysis on soft gamma-ray sources. NCT is one of the next generation of Compton telescopes{\textemdash}the so-called compact Compton telescopes (CCTs){\textemdash}which can achieve effective areas comparable to the Imaging Compton Telescope's with an instrument that is a fraction of the size. The Crab Nebula was the primary target for the second flight of the NCT instrument, which occurred on 2009 May 17 and 18 in Fort Sumner, New Mexico. Analysis of 29.3 ks of data from the flight reveals an image of the Crab at a significance of 4$\sigma$. This is the first reported detection of an astrophysical source by a CCT.},

abstract = {We analyse SPI/INTEGRAL data on the 511-keV line from the Galactic Centre, accumulated over ∼6 yr of observations. We decompose the X-ray and soft gamma-ray emission of the central part of the Milky Way into relatively compact 'bulge' and more extended 'disc' components and report their spectral properties. The bulge component shows a prominent 511-keV line and essentially no flux at 1.8 MeV, while the disc component on the contrary contains a prominent 1.8-MeV line and a very weak annihilation line. We show that the spectral shape of the annihilation radiation (the narrow 511-keV line and the associated ortho-positronium continuum) is surprisingly well described by a model of annihilation of hot positrons in a radiatively cooling interstellar medium (ISM). The model assumes that positrons are initially injected into a hot (∼106 K), volume-filling ISM, which is allowed to freely cool via radiative losses. The annihilation time in such a medium is longer than the cooling time for temperatures higher than a few 104 K. Thus, most of the positrons annihilate only after the gas has cooled down to ∼105 K, giving rise to annihilation emission characteristic of a warm, ionized ISM.},

abstract = {Neutral atomic hydrogen (Hi) traces the interstellar medium (ISM) over a broad range of physical conditions. Its 21-cm emission line is a key probe of the structure and dynamics of the Milky Way Galaxy. About 50 years after the first detection of the 21-cm line the exploration of the Hi distribution of the Milky Way has undergone a true renaissance. This was triggered by several large-scale 21-cm surveys that became available within the past decade. New all-sky surveys unravel the shape and volume density distribution of the gaseous disk up to its borders. High-resolution Galactic plane surveys disclose a wealth of shells, filaments, and spurs that bear witness to the recycling of matter between stars and the ISM. All these observational results indicate that the Hi gas traces a dynamical Galactic ISM with structures on all scales, from tens of astronomical units to kiloparsecs. The Galaxy can be considered to be a violent, breathing disk surrounded by highly turbulent extra-planar gas.},

abstract = {Auroral emissions of the giant planets (viz., Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) have been studied from ground-based observatories (e.g., IRTF, CFHT, Nan{\c c}ay), Earth-orbiting satellites (e.g., IUE, HST, ROSAT, Chandra), flyby spacecraft (e.g., Voyager, Cassini), and orbiting spacecraft platforms (e.g., Galileo) at x-ray, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, and radio wavelengths. While auroral processes are highly variable, the total emitted auroral power is a few tens of TW from Jupiter, a few tenths of a TW from Saturn and Uranus, and a few GW from Neptune. The main emissions are from various compounds of hydrogen (e.g., H and H2 at UV, visible, and near-IR (2-4$\mu$m) wavelengths; H+ in the near-IR) that are excited either directly by 3 a beam of energetic precipitating particles or by secondary electrons produced as the beam slows down in the atmosphere. Very energetic primary particles (or the heat they produce) can penetrate to beneath the homopause, resulting in hydrocarbon auroras-- particularly emissions of CH4 , C2 H2 , C2 H6 , and C2 H4 at thermal-IR (7-16$\mu$m) wavelengths (however, these emissions may also be excited by Joule heating). The x-ray and radio emissions are produced by the precipitating particles themselves. The emissions at different wavelengths provide unique and complimentary information about the physical processes operating in the atmospheric and magnetospheric regions where the auroras originate. Here we review our current understanding of auroral emissions from Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, as revealed through multispectral observations and supplemented by plasma measurements.},

abstract = {There is growing evidence that the Galactic Center Excess identified in the Fermi-LAT gamma-ray data arises from a population of faint astrophysical sources. We provide compelling supporting evidence by showing that the morphology of the excess traces the stellar over-density of the Galactic bulge. By adopting a template of the bulge stars obtained from a triaxial 3D fit to the diffuse near-infrared emission, we show that it is detected at high significance. The significance deteriorates when either the position or the orientation of the template is artificially shifted, supporting the correlation of the gamma-ray data with the Galactic bulge. In deriving these results, we have used more sophisticated templates at low-latitudes for the Fermi bubbles compared to previous work and the three-dimensional Inverse Compton (IC) maps recently released by the  GALPROP team. Our results provide strong constraints on Millisecond Pulsar (MSP) formation scenarios proposed to explain the excess. We find that an admixture formation scenario, in which some of the relevant binaries are primordial and the rest are formed dynamically, is preferred over a primordial-only formation scenario at 7.6$\sigma$ confidence level. Our detailed morphological analysis also disfavors models of the disrupted globular clusters scenario that predict a spherically symmetric distribution of MSPs in the Galactic bulge. For the first time, we report evidence of a high energy tail in the nuclear bulge spectrum that could be the result of IC emission from electrons and positrons injected by a population of MSPs and star formation activity from the same site.},

abstract = {A collimated high-resolution gamma ray spectrometer was flown on a balloon over Palestine, Texas, on June 10, 1974, to obtain measurements of the terrestrial and extraterrestrial 0.511-MeV gamma rays. The spectrometer consists of four 40-cu-cm Ge(Li) crystals operating in the energy range 0.06-10 MeV; this cluster of detectors is surrounded by a CsI(Na) anticoincidence shield. This system is used primarily to allow measurements of the two escape peaks associated with high-energy gamma ray lines. It also allows a measurement of the background component of the 0.511-MeV flux produced by beta(+) decays in materials inside the CsI(Na) shield. It is shown that the measurements of the atmospheric fluxes are consistent with earlier results after allowance is made for an additional component of the background due to beta(+) decays produced by neutron- and proton-initiated interactions with materials in and near the detector. Results of the extraterrestrial flux require an extensive detailed analysis of the time-varying background because of activation buildup and balloon spatial drifts.},

The OSSE instrument has measured well the flux in certain regions where it has been pointed long or often, but because of its small offset background subtraction technique and highly non-uniform exposure to date, it does not yet provide detailed constraints on the source distribution. Qualitatively and quantitatively different galactic distributions are consistent with the current data. In our opinion, claims of quantitative information about specific components, and of the existence of unforseen features are premature.},

In this work, we present a detailed inhomogeneous chemical evolution study that considers for the first time neutron star mergers as major r-process sources, and compare this scenario to the ones in which core-collapse supernovae act as dominant r-process sites. We conclude that, due to the lack of reliable iron and r-process yields as a function of progenitor mass, it is not possible at present to distinguish between the lower-mass and higher-mass supernovae scenarios within the framework of inhomogeneous chemical evolution. However, neutron-star mergers seem to be ruled out as the dominant r-process source, since their low rates of occurrence would lead to r-process enrichment that is not consistent with observations at very low metallicities. Additionally, the considerable injection of r-process material by a single neutron-star merger leads to a scatter in [r-process/Fe] ratios at later times which is much too large compared to observations.},

The currently available data sample the distance range from 100 pc to 20 kpc and cover 6500 deg2 of sky, mostly at high Galactic latitudes (|b| > 25). These stellar number density maps allow an investigation of the Galactic structure with no a priori assumptions about the functional form of its components. The data show strong evidence for a Galaxy consisting of an oblate halo, a disk component, and a number of localized overdensities. The number density distribution of stars as traced by M dwarfs in the solar neighborhood (D < 2 kpc) is well fit by two exponential disks (the thin and thick disk) with scale heights and lengths, bias corrected for an assumed 35% binary fraction, of H1 = 300 pc and L1 = 2600 pc, and H2 = 900 pc and L2 = 3600 pc, and local thick-to-thin disk density normalization $\rho$thick(R⊙)/$\rho$thin(R⊙) = 12% . We use the stars near main-sequence turnoff to measure the shape of the Galactic halo. We find a strong preference for oblate halo models, with best-fit axis ratio c/a = 0.64, $\rho$H propto r-2.8 power-law profile, and the local halo-to-thin disk normalization of 0.5%. Based on a series of Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate the errors of derived model parameters not to be larger than {\textasciitilde}20% for the disk scales and {\textasciitilde}10% for the density normalization, with largest contributions to error coming from the uncertainty in calibration of the photometric parallax relation and poorly constrained binary fraction. While generally consistent with the above model, the measured density distribution shows a number of statistically significant localized deviations. In addition to known features, such as the Monoceros stream, we detect two overdensities in the thick disk region at cylindrical galactocentric radii and heights (R,Z) {\textasciitilde} (6.5,1.5) kpc and (R,Z) {\textasciitilde} (9.5,0.8) kpc and a remarkable density enhancement in the halo covering over 1000 deg2 of sky toward the constellation of Virgo, at distances of {\textasciitilde}6-20 kpc. Compared to counts in a region symmetric with respect to the l = 0{\textdegree} line and with the same Galactic latitude, the Virgo overdensity is responsible for a factor of 2 number density excess and may be a nearby tidal stream or a low-surface brightness dwarf galaxy merging with the Milky Way. The u - g color distribution of stars associated with it implies metallicity lower than that of thick disk stars and consistent with the halo metallicity distribution. After removal of the resolved overdensities, the remaining data are consistent with a smooth density distribution; we detect no evidence of further unresolved clumpy substructure at scales ranging from {\textasciitilde}50 pc in the disk to {\textasciitilde}1-2 kpc in the halo.},

For the first time in a NuSTAR analysis, we consistently take into account the signal contribution from both the focused and unfocused fields of view. We also reduce the modeling systematic uncertainty by performing spectral fits to each observation individually and statistically combining the results, instead of stacking the spectra. We find no evidence of unknown lines, and thus derive limits on the sterile neutrino parameters. Our results place stringent constraints for dark matter masses ≳12 keV , which reduces the available parameter space for sterile neutrino dark matter produced via neutrino mixing (e.g., in the $\nu$ MSM ) by approximately one-third. Additional NuSTAR observations, together with improved low-energy background modeling, could probe the remaining parameter space in the future. Lastly, we also report model-independent limits on generic dark matter decay rates and annihilation cross sections.},

abstract = {Millisecond pulsars are very likely the main source of gamma-ray emission from globular clusters. However, the relative contributions of two separate emission processes-curvature radiation from millisecond pulsar magnetospheres vs. inverse Compton emission from relativistic pairs launched into the globular cluster environment by millisecond pulsars-has long been unclear. To address this, we search for evidence of inverse Compton emission in 8-year Fermi-LAT data from the directions of 157 Milky Way globular clusters. We find a mildly statistically significant (3.8$\sigma$) correlation between the measured globular cluster gamma-ray luminosities and their photon field energy densities. However, this may also be explained by a hidden correlation between the photon field densities and the stellar encounter rates of globular clusters. Analysed in toto, we demonstrate that the gamma-ray emission of globular clusters can be resolved spectrally into two components: i) an exponentially cut-off power law and ii) a pure power law. The latter component-which we uncover at a significance of 8.2$\sigma$-is most naturally interpreted as inverse Compton emission by cosmic-ray electrons and positrons injected by millisecond pulsars. We find the luminosity of this inverse Compton component is comparable to, or slightly smaller than, the luminosity of the curved component, suggesting the fraction of millisecond pulsar spin-down luminosity into relativistic leptons is similar to the fraction of the spin-down luminosity into prompt magnetospheric radiation.},

abstract = {Recent progress in wide field of view or all-sky observations such as Swift/BAT hard X-ray monitor and Fermi GeV gamma-ray observatory has opened up a new era of time-domain high energy astro-physics addressing new insight in, e.g., particle acceleration in the universe. MeV coverage with comparable sensitivity, i.e. 1 {\textasciitilde} 10 mCrab is missing and a new MeV all-sky observatory is needed. These new MeV mission tend to be large, power- consuming and hence expensive, and its realization is yet to come. A compact sub-MeV (0.2-2 MeV) all-sky mission is proposed as a path finder for such mission. It is based on a Si/CdTe semiconductor Compton telescope technology employed in the soft gamma-ray detector onboard ASTRO-H, to be launched in to orbit on late 2015. The mission is kept as small as 0:5 X 0:5 X 0:4 m3, 150 kg in weight and 200 W in power in place of the band coverage above a few MeV, in favor of early realization as a sub-payload to other large platforms, such as the international space station.},

abstract = {Soft x-ray emissions with brightnesses of about 0.01-0.2 Rayleighs have been observed from both the equatorial and auroral regions of Jupiter. It has been proposed that the equatorial emission, like the auroral emission, may be largely due to precipitation of energetic heavy ions into the atmosphere [Waite et al., 1997]. In this paper we model two alternative mechanisms for low-latitude x-ray emission: (1) elastic scattering of solar x-rays by atmospheric neutrals, (2) fluorescent scattering of carbon K-shell x-rays from methane molecules located below the jovian homopause. Our modeled brightnesses agree, up to a factor of two, with the bulk of low-latitude ROSAT measurements. This suggests that solar photon scattering (approximately 90% elastic scattering) may act in conjunction with energetic heavy ion precipitation to generate jovian equatorial x-ray emission.},

abstract = {Context. The coded-mask spectrometer-telescope SPI on board the INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) records photons in the energy range between 20 and 8000 keV. A robust and versatile method for modelling the dominating instrumental background radiation is difficult to establish for such a telescope in the rapidly changing space environment. Aims: In a previous paper we presented our spectral parameter database, developed from long-term monitoring of the SPI germanium detectors, that characterises the instrument response and background behaviour. Our aim is to build a self-consistent and broadly applicable background model for typical science cases of INTEGRAL/SPI based on this database. Methods: The general analysis method for SPI relies on distinguishing between illumination patterns on the 19-element germanium detector array from background and sky in a maximum-likelihood framework. We illustrate how the complete set of measurements, even including the exposures of the sources of interest, can be used to define a background model. The observation strategy of INTEGRAL makes it possible to determine individual background components, originating from continuum and $\gamma$-ray line emission. We apply our method to different science cases, including point-like, diffuse, continuum, and line emission, and evaluate the adequacy in each case. Results: From likelihood values and the number of fitted parameters, we determine how strong the impact of the unknown background variability is. We find that the number of fitted parameters, i.e. how often the background has to be re-normalised, depends on the emission type (diffuse with many observations over a large sky region, or point-like with concentrated exposure around one source), the spectral energy range, and bandwidth. A unique timescale, valid for all analysis issues, is not applicable for INTEGRAL/SPI, but must and can be inferred from the chosen data set. Conclusions: We conclude that our background modelling method can be used in a wide variety of INTEGRAL/SPI science cases, and provides nearly systematics-free and robust results.},
